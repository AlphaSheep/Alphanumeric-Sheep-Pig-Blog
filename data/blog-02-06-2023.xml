      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

programming project that I set for the students involved writing a number of matrix operations in pure Python (that is, using built-in functions only - I specifically disallowed the use of any imported modules like NumPy). Transposition and matrix multiplication are fairly simple to do, but the challenge is in writing a function to invert a matrix. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Gauss-Jordan elimination (which should be covered in any first year algebra course) is one of the easier ways to do this. I wrote a fairly long but simple-to-understand function to give out to the students as a model solution at the end of the project, but I was wondering, how short could a working matrix inversion function be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came up with the function below, complete with partial pivoting, which seems to work correctly. It could probably be even shorter, but I think I achieved what I set out to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/AlphaSheep/36291e29b63c8b6905bb.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The input argument A is simply a nested list, such as &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A = [[1,2,3],[1,5,9],[7,5,2]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Line 3 simply augments the matrix with the identity matrix. The for loop on line 4 loops through each row, and sets the element on the main diagonal to 1, and every element above and below that element to zero. This happens in three steps. The first step, on line 5, is a simple pivoting step. It sorts all of the remaining rows such that the current row will be divided by the number with the largest possible magnitude (to avoid division by zero, and improve the accuracy if the matrix contains very small numbers). The second step (line 6) is to divide each element in the row by the element on the main diagonal, leaving a 1 on the main diagonal. The third step (line 7) is a little more complicated. For each row that is not the current row, we subtract the current row multiplied by the element in the column index equal to the index of the current row. This will set each element in the current column to zero, except for the element in the current row, which remains 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net result is that the left hand side of the augmented matrix becomes the identity matrix, while the right hand side becomes the inverse. All that's left is to separate the two, and return the inverse. This happens on line 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know who would find this post useful, because it's better to just use numpy, but it is certainly a fun exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1076544654124381320/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1076544654124381320&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1076544654124381320'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1076544654124381320'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2015/06/on-matrix-inversion-in-python.html' title='On Matrix Inversion in Python'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8414107300997127460</id><published>2014-09-15T22:14:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-09-15T22:14:58.990+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Basic Suburban Ornithology in Johannesburg</title><content type='html'>Surprisingly, many people don't recognise many of the birds they find in their gardens. In fact, many of them can go completely unnoticed. My parents have always tried hard to keep a garden that attracts a wide variety of birds, many of which are not usually seen in built-up areas. It was only natural for me to learn the names of many of them. Here is a list of some of the most common birds seen in Johannesburg gardens on an almost daily basis, that you really should be able to name.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Doves and Pigeons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border="0" width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Laughing_dove_%28spilopelia_senegalensis%29.jpg/320px-Laughing_dove_%28spilopelia_senegalensis%29.jpg" width="170px"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/2012_Ring-necked_Dove.jpg" width="145px"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Wohlgen%C3%A4hrte_Stadttauben.jpg/320px-Wohlgen%C3%A4hrte_Stadttauben.jpg" width="160px"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;Laughing Dove&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;Cape turtle dove&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;Feral Pigeon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:60%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Charlesjsharp"&gt;Charles Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:60%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Yathin_sk"&gt;Yathin S Krishnappa&lt;/a&gt;, 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:60%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexander_Gamauf"&gt;Alexander Gamauf&lt;/a&gt;, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/01/on-pigeons-and-doves.html"&gt;written about pigeons and doves before&lt;/a&gt;, and how to tell the difference between them. Simply put, we have three common species. The smaller reddish-grey laughing dove, the slightly larger greyer Cape turtle dove, with the black ring around its neck, and the even larger feral pigeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Hadedas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border="0" width="99%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Hadada_Ibis.jpg/320px-Hadada_Ibis.jpg" width="240px"&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;Hadeda ibis&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:60%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dawidl"&gt;Dawidl&lt;/a&gt;, 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-rudest-awakening.html"&gt;written about the Hadeda ibis before&lt;/a&gt;, or more specifically, about the horrendous noise they make, particularly in the early hours of the morning.

It's call is a whistle which sounds like a full conversation, with a distinctive questioning tone, followed by an answer. I've always thought of it as sounding like "How are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; today?" "I'm great, thank-you, yourself?" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Bulbuls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulbul (Common bulbul)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;du-dit du-deet du-dit du-dit du-doe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Cuckoos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red-chested cuckoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Sparrows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparrow (Cape sparrow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Mynahs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian mynah (Common myna)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Thrushes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrush (Olive thrush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Weavers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaver (Southern masked weaver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;White-eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White-eye (Cape white-eye)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Barbets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbets (Crested barbet and black-collared barbet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Hoopoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoopoe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Starlings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starling (Cape starling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Wagtails&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wagtail (Cape wagtail)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Louries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey lourie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Mousebirds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mousebird (Speckled mousebird)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Shrikes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiscal shrike (Southern fiscal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Flycatchers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiscal flycatcher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8414107300997127460&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8414107300997127460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8414107300997127460'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-285166972058369489</id><published>2014-09-02T21:25:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-09-02T21:25:27.627+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On My 13 Favourite Pieces of Metal Music</title><content type='html'>The music I listen to falls mainly into the genres of metal and classical music. A while ago, I put together a list of my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/02/favourite-classical-music.html"&gt;13 favourite pieces of classical music&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided it was about time to put together a list of my favourite metal music. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;Funnily enough, I find that classical music gets me worked up, and if I want to relax, no other music works quite as well as metal. I'm not very good at having favourites, so I should probably point out that there may be some more deserving songs out there that were accidentally overlooked, and my favourites change from day to day. However, these are the ones that I'd have to consistently include near the top of a list like this, but they are in no particular order. Once again, I have limited myself to one song per artist, and I have not listed songs that have made lists on this blog before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpUtyrRaS1Q" &gt;Moonsorrow - &lt;i&gt;Raunioilla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moonsorrow is my all-purpose music. No matter what mood I'm in, I'm in the mood for Moonsorrow. It's my first choice when I have to concentrate on work, or when I want to sit back and relax, or when I'm stressed, or sad, or really happy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xpUtyrRaS1Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDe0cXJc-kw" &gt;Rhapsody of Fire - &lt;i&gt;Queen of the Dark Horizons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhapsody of Fire's album &lt;i&gt;Rain of a Thousand Flames&lt;/i&gt; is considered a filler album, as it only plays a small side role in the epic story they tell through their music. Still, it contains some of their best work, and &lt;i&gt;Queen of the Dark Horizons&lt;/i&gt; is easily my favourite song of theirs. It is a perfect mix of symphonic and power metal, and I love every second of its 13 and a half minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cDe0cXJc-kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9AXC31V3o" &gt;Cradle of Filth - &lt;i&gt;Nymphetamine (Fix)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother went through a phase where he listened to nothing but Cradle of Filth. Musically, I think they are brilliant, but I never liked Dani Filth's screaming. With exposure though, I did grow accustomed to it eventually. The one song that stood out was &lt;i&gt;Nymphetamine&lt;/i&gt; (perhaps because Liv Kristine sings a large portion of the song), from the album of the same name. The song appears twice on the album, but the first version (the overdose) has a mismatched intro and outro which just don't fit in with the rest of the song. For that reason, I prefer just the fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yk9AXC31V3o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR8d_TVKJ24" &gt;Deathstars - &lt;i&gt;Razor End&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I had heard a little of the Deathstars' music before I met my girlfriend, I had never heard &lt;i&gt;Razor End&lt;/i&gt;. We'd been dating for just a couple of weeks when she had my taste in music completely figured out. She burned me a CD, which had this song on. It's a pity it's not on any Deathstars album, because I feel it's easily their best work. Four and a half years later, it was still one of the easiest songs to choose when I started putting together this list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TR8d_TVKJ24" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF9klwct9_0" &gt;Anathema - &lt;i&gt;Eternity, Part I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always had a taste for depressing doom metal, and that's what led me to Anathema. I enjoy almost all of Anathema's music, from their work in the early 90's, up to their latest albums. Listening to all of their albums in order and hearing the progression in style from doom metal to through to alternative rock is a fascinating experience in itself. &lt;i&gt;Eternity, Part I&lt;/i&gt; is the first of three parts, and is written in a rather heavy doom metal style. The second part is a soft instrumental piece, and the third part closes off the first with a more progressive style, and cleaner vocals. I encourage you to listen to all three parts, but the first is definitely my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jF9klwct9_0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNhvGmW4q_w" &gt;In Flames - &lt;i&gt;Come Clarity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Flames is a band I have mixed feelings about. There are many of their songs that I thoughroughly enjoy, and then there are others that I cannot stand. &lt;i&gt;Come Clarity&lt;/i&gt; is one of their softer songs, and I'm not sure what it is about the song that makes me love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cNhvGmW4q_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxMkIm5JxkM" &gt;Wintersun - &lt;i&gt;Death and the Healing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple songs from Wintersun which were strong contenders for this list. &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Death&lt;/i&gt; was probably at the top, but it has already been listed on this blog as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/10/on-end-of-world-part-ii.html"&gt;soundtrack for the end of the world&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I chose &lt;i&gt;Death and the Healing&lt;/i&gt;. The slower pace and clean vocals make the song really stand out from the melodic black metal that makes up the rest of the album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pxMkIm5JxkM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtiW6TgzhDA" &gt;Metallica - &lt;i&gt;No Leaf Clover&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Metallica reached 30 years old, I compiled a list of my 30 favourite Metallica songs. Of them, 27 were released in the first 15 years of their career, and only 3 in the second 15 years. Also, I really don't like live music. It's rather funny then that my absolute favourite Metallica song was only released in the band's 19th year, and only ever as a live recording. I think it has something to do with the symphonic elements. I just wish there was a studio recording of the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PtiW6TgzhDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuhEDECXOhE" &gt;Nightwish - &lt;i&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time, Nightwish was my favourite band. For the last few years, however, there just seems to be something missing from their music (I wonder what it could be?) Even though it's not an original song, &lt;i&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;/i&gt; seems to epitomise everything I loved about the band when they were at the peak of their career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yuhEDECXOhE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;10. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UigqgJ6cMJE" &gt;Lordi - &lt;i&gt;It Snows in Hell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The piano intro to this song is really simple to pick up and play, and really catchy, and I'm constantly getting the chorus stuck in my head. There's also something about the guitar solo that makes me think of a lazy Sunday afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UigqgJ6cMJE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;11. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCUx5WKIZ1E" &gt;Bathory - &lt;i&gt;The Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the album &lt;i&gt;Blood on Ice&lt;/i&gt; was written in the late 80's, it wasn't released because the band were worried that it was too different to any of their other music. At the time, Bathory was known for their fast-paced black metal. Through the first half of the 90's, they changed their style, and began to define the Viking metal genre. In 1996, the band finally decided that they were ready to releace &lt;i&gt;Blood on Ice&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Lake&lt;/i&gt; was the first song on the album that I heard, and remains my favourite to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yCUx5WKIZ1E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;12. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvIW2dVv8GU" &gt;Therion - &lt;i&gt;To Mega Therion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therion is the metal band that has experimented (mostly successfully) with more styles than any other band I have heard. &lt;i&gt;To Mega Therion&lt;/i&gt; is from their album &lt;i&gt;Theli&lt;/i&gt;, which was the first album to drop their death metal roots entirely. &lt;i&gt;To Mega Therion&lt;/i&gt; features a full orchestra and choir, interspersed with raspy male vocals and catchy guitar and keyboard solos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wvIW2dVv8GU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;13. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWpwC1p-Ilw" &gt;Green Carnation - &lt;i&gt;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this song (if it can be called that) is just over an hour long. When I first heard about it, I expected it to be drawn out and repetitive, but it is far from it. The style and tempo of the music varies throughout the song, so that it easily maintains my interest for the full hour. I once heard a shortened version in which the song had been cut to ten minutes, and even though the editing had been done extremely well, and the transitions fitted in perfectly, I found that the song was seriously lacking. The full hour needs to be heard in one go. In my opinion, not a single second can be cut out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LWpwC1p-Ilw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Legal notice: I obviously don't claim to own any of the songs or videos in this post.

It's a puzzle that many people associate with intelligence, mathematical ability, and good problem solving skills, but being able to solve it actually has nothing to do with any of those. The only things you need are basic pattern recognition and muscle memory - both of which everyone has anyway. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. My first cubes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Rubik's cube was even older than I am. My dad bought two of them (one with standard colours, and one with pictures of fruit) some time in the early 80's when they first became popular, together with a short book explaining how to solve them. I found the book in 1996, shortly after we'd moved house. I asked my dad about it, and he found the two cubes for me. Not wanting to cheat, I scrambled one and tried solving it myself. It didn't take long to figure out how to solve one side, but I quickly realised that any turn inevitably messed up four sides, got frustrated, and moved on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back to them a couple years later. This time, I actually tried reading the book. The first chapter was all about the internal mechanism, and how to take the cube apart. Naturally, I stopped reading there and did exactly that. I took them both apart, and put them back together in a solved state, and began to look at how various turns affected the faces. Whenever I got stuck in a position that I couldn't solve, I would take the cube apart, and put it back together. After a while, the core of one of the cubes broke while I was taking it apart. Having made very slow progress, and having lost a cube, my 12 year old brain decided it had more interesting things to do, so I moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. Solving the damn thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I came back the the cube a few years later. I think I was about 17 years old this time, and far more patient. I only had the cube with the fruit stickers left, so I had to be more careful. I decided to read the book, and I approached it the same way I would approach a school text book. I took a notepad and a pencil, and began to take notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book described a very simple layer-by-layer method for solving the cube. You would start by inserting the four edges on the top face, and then execute a simple algorithm until they cycled into the correct positions. Then you would insert the four corners of that face, then the four edges of the middle layer. At this point, the top two layers of the cube were solved. To finish the last layer, you had to switch some corner pieces in the bottom layer to get them in the correct position, then execute an algorithm over and over until they were oriented correctly. Then, you would execute an algorithm to cycle the last four edges, until they were in the correct position, and finally you would execute one of three algorithms to flip them into the correct orientation. The book claimed that the method required an average of about 120 moves to solve the cube. There were a total of nine algorithms to learn, and it only took a couple of days to memorise them all (it's surprisingly easy if you just let muscle memory take over).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch was the centres. The book assumed that the cube had stickers with a solid colour, but my cube had little pictures of fruits. All of them would point the same direction except for the centres. I later learned that a cube like this is called a supercube, and some people draw arrows (or buy stickers with arrows) to turn their Rubik's cubes into supercubes. I was not content having my centres pointing the wrong way, so I sat down and figured out a couple of algorithms myself that would allow me to orient five of the six centres while solving the cube. I noticed that a couple of the algorithms I already knew rotated one or two centres if I repeated them three times, and with that, I could solve the cube, centres included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solving a Rubik's cube is a very relaxing task. It takes very little brain power, and is actually very meditative. Apart from occasionally glancing down to see which algorithm you need to execute next, you don't even really have to watch what you're doing. I used to solve my cube several times a week, just to meditate and relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. Moving on: new Cubes and new methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fruit cube lasted a surprisingly long time. After several years, it began to lock up occasionally. A couple years after that, pieces began to pop out every now and then. By late 2012, the pieces became so loose that it reached a stage where it would lock up on almost every turn, and it became almost impossible to solve without the whole thing exploding in my hands. I needed a new cube, so I bought one: a cheap Chinese cube from a flea market stall. The stickers lasted less than two weeks, and it was less than a month before one of the edges broke in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was then that I decided to take things seriously. I went online and did some research, and discovered the fascinating world of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing"&gt;speedcubing&lt;/a&gt;. I discovered that the world record at the time was less than six seconds, and that &lt;a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=333&amp;regionId=&amp;years=&amp;show=1000%2BPersons&amp;average=Average"&gt;more than a thousand people&lt;/a&gt; around the world can solve a Rubik's cube in under fifteen seconds almost all the time! It put my two and a half minutes to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out what makes of cube were actually considered good quality, and found a stickerless DaYan GuHong on sale. While waiting for my new cube to arrive (it took two months, thanks to a useless Postal service), I found a Rubik's 2x2 cube in a local toy store. I could solve it by adapting the 3x3 method, but it felt very slow and inefficient. I learnt to solve it using the &lt;a href="http://www.cubewhiz.com/ortega.php"&gt;Ortega method&lt;/a&gt;, which is a much faster method specially developed for 2x2 cubes, which is also fairly light on algorithms (you actually only need two of them, but learning up to eleven makes things faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conveniently, my GuHong arrived the day before I left for America to present a paper a conference. A 15 hour plane flight is absolutely perfect for learning a new method. I made a short cheat sheet with the algorithms for the &lt;a href="http://cube.crider.co.uk/"&gt;ZZ method&lt;/a&gt;, and between the two plane flights, I managed to memorize them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;4. Speedcubing: attempt #1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month, a toy store near my girlfriend's house held a Rubik's cube competition. When I had first looked in 2013, there were only &lt;a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=333&amp;regionId=South%2BAfrica&amp;years=until%2B2013&amp;show=100%2BPersons&amp;average=Average"&gt;six South Africans ranked by the World cube Association&lt;/a&gt;, and speedcubing in the country seemed pretty much non-existent. I was fairly surprised to see an actual competition. I checked the World Cube Association website, only to see that the first official competition had been held a few months before, and more than thirty people had attended, two of whom had managed to set times under fifteen seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It led me to find &lt;a href="http://www.speedcubes.co.za/"&gt;speedcubes.co.za&lt;/a&gt;, a South African online store that stocks a range of the world's leading speed cube brands. I told myself that if I could solve my cube ten times with an average time less than 90 seconds (a minute faster than a year before), then I would allow myself to buy a new cube. I made it, but only just. In ten solves, my best time was 1:22, with an average of 1:29.8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my new cube, a DaYan ZhanChi (since my stickerless GuHong is technically not competition legal), as well as a new 2x2 (my Rubik's brand one had a cracked core), and a 4x4 cube. With these new cubes, together with a couple of key rings, I can officially say that I have begun a bit of a collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0QEwKPt-gE0/U72AG9toHqI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gjxiUaa_V9c/s480/Cubes2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed my first competition. By some miracle, I actually won the 2x2 category with an average of just over 16 seconds (my five solves took 13, 15, 15, 18 and 32 seconds). In the 3x3 category, I came nowhere near the winning average of 45 seconds. My best time was 53 seconds, and I averaged just over a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;5. Next goal: An official WCA ranking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's going to be an official WCA ranking event in Johannesburg on 23 November, and one in Cape Town on 30 November. This leaves me four and a half months to practice and get my times down. My goal is to set at least one time less than 30 seconds at that event. I'm improving fairly quickly. As of 30 June, my average time over 100 timed solves was 1:15.62. By 8 July, my average time over 100 solves had dropped to 57.93 seconds, and my current personal best is 42.65 seconds. 30 seconds may seem ambitious, but I'm fairly confident that I will be able to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7008484320096643346/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7008484320096643346&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7008484320096643346'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7008484320096643346'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2014/07/on-rubiks-cube.html' title='On Rubik&apos;s Cube'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0QEwKPt-gE0/U72AG9toHqI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gjxiUaa_V9c/s72-c/Cubes2.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5773740540255505531</id><published>2014-05-01T21:10:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-05-02T09:45:43.356+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='spaaaaaace'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video game mechanics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On The Fuel-Optimal Ascent Speed in Kerbal Space Program</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/"&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/a&gt; is a sandbox-style spaceflight simulator game developed by Squad. The player designs and assembles spacecraft by piecing together a wide range of components, and then launches and flies them. The game places an emphasis on the realistic modelling of various physics, including structural failure of components, aerodynamic lift and drag, and accurate orbital mechanics. It should come as no surprise to learn that I absolutely love this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It is &lt;a href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Drag#Terminal_velocity"&gt;widely known and claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the most fuel efficient ascent speed for a spacecraft in  Kerbal Space Program is the terminal velocity. However, not many people can actually explain exactly why this is. The whole thing has given rise to a number of misconceptions about terminal velocities and aerodynamic drag, so I felt I had to clear these up.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll also go through the math to calculate the actual fuel optimal ascent speed (which just happens to be equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the terminal velocity), because I couldn't find it explained anywhere else. I didn't really believe the claims until I did the math myself, so hopefully this will help those who are not convinced by all the half-baked whishy-washy arguments out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. What is the terminal velocity?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people seem to think that the terminal velocity is the maximum speed a rocket can reach. I don't know where this comes from, but it's absolutely false. The terminal velocity of an object is the speed at which an object will fall through air &lt;i&gt;in the absence of all forces other than gravity and air resistance&lt;/i&gt;. That is, the only forces acting on the object are gravity and air resistance, or aerodynamic drag. Finding the terminal velocity is as simple as equating the weight of the object (a constant) to the drag (which varies with the square of the speed), and solving for speed. If an object is falling faster than the terminal velocity, air resistance will cause it to slow down. If it's falling slower than the terminal velocity, gravity will speed it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get an object to fall faster than the terminal velocity, one simply needs needs to apply a downward force in addition to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note is that the terminal velocity is always directed down. That's because at the terminal velocity, gravity and drag are equal in magnitude, but directly opposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. What does this have to do with going up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terminal velocity applies only to falling objects in the absence of other forces, so what is the relevance of the terminal velocity when your rocket is going up? The answer is, not much. It's just a useful reference point. Below the terminal velocity, your engines are doing more work to overcome gravity than drag. Above the terminal velocity, your engines are doing more work against drag than gravity. At the terminal velocity, exactly 50% of the work your engines do goes to overcoming gravity, and exactly 50% goes to overcoming drag. There's no reason why you can't just apply more thrust to ascend faster, or less thrust to ascend slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. Calculating the terminal velocity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here on out, we're doing math. Hopefully this doesn't scare you off. As we've already pointed out, the terminal velocity occurs when the weight of the object acting downwards exactly balances the drag acting upwards. The weight is given by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;W&amp;space;=&amp;space;m&amp;space;g}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;W&amp;space;=&amp;space;m&amp;space;g}" title="{\color{White} W = m g}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;m}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;m}" title="{\color{White} m}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the object's mass, and &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;g}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;g}" title="{\color{White} g}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the gravitational acceleration (which we can assume is constant if we're considering only very small changes in altitude).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drag depends on several factors: the air density, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\rho}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\rho}" title="{\color{White} \rho}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cross-sectional area of our rocket, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;A}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;A}" title="{\color{White} A}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drag coefficient, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;C_d}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;C_d}" title="{\color{White} C_d}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the square of the object's velocity, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V}" title="{\color{White} V}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The equation is &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;D=&amp;space;\frac{1}{2}\rho&amp;space;A&amp;space;C_d&amp;space;V^2}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;D=&amp;space;\frac{1}{2}\rho&amp;space;A&amp;space;C_d&amp;space;V^2}" title="{\color{White} D= \frac{1}{2}\rho A C_d V^2}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terminal velocity occurs when these two forces are equal.

Calculating the optimal ascent speed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're now going to calculate the optimal ascent speed. As far as we're aware (at this stage), that has nothing to do with the terminal velocity, so we're going to start from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do this, we're going to try find the mass of fuel that needs to be burnt to increase altitude by a small amount, and then use some basic calculus to find the speed that minimizes that. First, we'll need an expression for the change in altitude at a given speed. That's easy to do if we assume that the speed is constant. This is approximately true, provided we're considering a very small change in altitude:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h&amp;space;=&amp;space;V&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h&amp;space;=&amp;space;V&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" title="{\color{White} \Delta h = V \Delta t}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V}" title="{\color{White} V}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the speed, and &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" title="{\color{White} \Delta t}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the time taken to change the altitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't actually know what this change in time is, so we'd like to find another expression for it, preferably one that doesn't involve speed. To do that, we're going to make use of the rocket's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics)"&gt;impulse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;\int_{t_0}^{t_1}&amp;space;F&amp;space;dt}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;\int_{t_0}^{t_1}&amp;space;F&amp;space;dt}" title="{\color{White} I = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} F dt}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we assume that we're looking at a very short period of time, so that the thrust is approximately constant, then this simplifies to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;F&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;F&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t}" title="{\color{White} I = F \Delta t}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we need to calculate this impulse. Fortunately, the impulse, as you might guess, is very closely related to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_impulse"&gt;specific impulse&lt;/a&gt;, which is a property of the engine, and is readily available for various engines in KSP. The specific impulse is defined as the impulse delivered per unit weight (at standard gravity, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;g_0}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;g_0}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} g_0}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the gravity at sea level on Kerbin) of propellant burned. Therefore, we can calculate the impulse from the weight of fuel burned, and the specific impulse of the engine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I&amp;space;=&amp;space;I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} I = I_{sp} \Delta m_{f} g_0}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Substituting this into our expression for impulse above, and solving for the time, we get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}{F}}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;t&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}{F}}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} \Delta t = \frac{I_{sp} \Delta m_{f} g_0}{F}}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so our expression for the change in altitude at a given speed becomes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}{F}V}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{I_{sp}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_{f}&amp;space;g_0}{F}V}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} \Delta h = \frac{I_{sp} \Delta m_{f} g_0}{F}V}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, solving for the amount of fuel burned, we get an expression for the fuel required to increase altitude by a certain amount at any given speed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_f&amp;space;=&amp;space;\left(\frac{F&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h}{I_{sp}g_0}\right)\frac{1}{V}}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;m_f&amp;space;=&amp;space;\left(\frac{F&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h}{I_{sp}g_0}\right)\frac{1}{V}}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} \Delta m_f = \left(\frac{F \Delta h}{I_{sp}g_0}\right)\frac{1}{V}}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't know how much thrust we need to produce to maintain the optimum velocity. However, we can calculate what this value needs to be based on the two assumptions we've already made. We've assumed that the thrust is constant, and we've assumed that the velocity is constant. This means that thrust will be exactly balanced by the sum of the rocket's weight, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;W}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;W}" title="{\color{White} W}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and drag, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;D}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;D}" title="{\color{White} D}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This is a standard optimisation problem, and means we need to set the derivative of the objective function to zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\frac{d}{dv}\left(\Delta&amp;space;m_f&amp;space;\right)&amp;space;=&amp;space;0&amp;space;}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\frac{d}{dv}\left(\Delta&amp;space;m_f&amp;space;\right)&amp;space;=&amp;space;0&amp;space;}" title="{\color{White} \frac{d}{dv}\left(\Delta m_f \right) = 0 }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That derivative is fairly easy to get with basic calculus.

Move the first term across to the other side, cancel &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;\Delta&amp;space;h}" title="{\color{White} \Delta h}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I_{sp}g_0}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;I_{sp}g_0}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} I_{sp}g_0}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on each side and then multiply through by &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V^2}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;V^2}" title="{\color{White} V^2}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves the following expression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;mg&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{1}{2}\rho&amp;space;A&amp;space;C_d&amp;space;V^2}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\bg_black&amp;space;{\color{White}&amp;space;mg&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{1}{2}\rho&amp;space;A&amp;space;C_d&amp;space;V^2}" title="{\color{White} mg = \frac{1}{2}\rho A C_d V^2}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does that look familiar? It should. This is the exact same equation we had to solve to calculate the terminal velocity. The term on the left is simply the weight, and the term on the right is the drag. This means that the speed that minimises the fuel required to increase in altitude just happens to be the speed at which weight and drag are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that the velocity that gives a fuel optimal ascent is equal in magnitude to the terminal velocity, but in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5773740540255505531/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5773740540255505531&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5773740540255505531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5773740540255505531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2014/05/ksp-fuel-optimal-ascent.html' title='On The Fuel-Optimal Ascent Speed in Kerbal Space Program'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3114052846136914939</id><published>2014-03-14T10:51:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2014-03-14T11:24:24.556+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='programming'/><title type='text'>On QuickCoords - A tool for quickly capturing coordinates across a series of images.</title><content type='html'>I needed an easy way to manually track the positions of features across a series of more than 600 photographs.

Over the past few years, I've been asked too many questions like "When will you finish?" and "How many pages does your thesis have to be?" The answers are actually surprisingly simple: "When I'm done" and "Enough".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I'll start by telling you about the official Rules and Syllabuses of my faculty. This is a three hundred and something page document that goes into a lot of detail into what you need to get various degrees. For undergraduate courses, it will go into some detail about what courses of specific lengths you need to take, how many credits each course is worth, the minimum number of credits required in each year, and summarises the basic requirements for each course and how they are assessed and examined. When it comes to a PhD, though, the rules are pretty vague. Here's what it says: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conditions for the award of PhD:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy shall –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;present for the approval of the Senate a thesis which must constitute a substantial contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the subject chosen, which thesis must be satisfactory as regards literary presentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; present himself/herself for such assessment as the Senate may determine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a little more about admission requirements, having an advisor, examiners, something about spending a minimum of two years, and a how many copies of the final thesis need to be handed in (it's five, by the way, not counting the electronic copy), but that covers the gist of it. In summary, I need to do some research and write a thesis on it. Nothing about a page count at all. There's just that one requirement: it "must constitute a substantial contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the subject chosen", whatever that may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally though, after a few years of research, one can produce a hell of a lot of rubbish. When writing up a thesis, it's natural to start to wonder how much of that actually needs to go in.  How much of it would be considered an acceptable amount of filler material to bulk up the actual content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My University has been operating for a little under a century, and there's a basement level in one of the libraries that is packed with past theses arranged by subject. You could walk through there to try figure out how long a thesis should be, but there are many there that are five or six hundred pages long, and some that are just a few dozen. However, it's not to difficult to see that theses written under the same advisor often land up being similar lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, curious as to where I stood (and because I'm sick of endlessly processing results), I went down to the library and pulled down five recent theses in my field that had been written under my advisor. So, instead of plotting the results of my experiments, I plotted a breakdown of each of those theses and compared them to what I have at the moment. The similarities in length and structure are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vkvK8UeARx0/UwTDoQEMVpI/AAAAAAAAArQ/F7_JUgDo2eY/s1600/PhDProgress.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vkvK8UeARx0/UwTDoQEMVpI/AAAAAAAAArQ/F7_JUgDo2eY/s1600/PhDProgress.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's me on the right, just next to the average thesis. My introduction is a couple pages longer than average (with about 2 pages left to write), and my methodology is about 7 pages below average (although I shoved about 20 pages into an appendix, so maybe it's longer than average), and my conclusion is a blank page right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's reassuring to see that my results are the only thing left to type up. And with more than 600 photographs from experiments to process, and 260 GB of data from computer simulations to sift through, I don't think I'm going to have a problem adding the 81 pages that will take me past the average thesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to finish by the end of this month, but here I am procrastinating again. It looks like I may just need a little bit longer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5920633389177615821/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5920633389177615821&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5920633389177615821'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5920633389177615821'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2014/02/on-the-elusive-PhD.html' title='On the Elusive Doctor of Philosophy'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vkvK8UeARx0/UwTDoQEMVpI/AAAAAAAAArQ/F7_JUgDo2eY/s72-c/PhDProgress.PNG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8876110872852517438</id><published>2014-01-17T09:52:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2014-01-17T09:52:39.604+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='land marks'/><title type='text'>On... a fifth arbitrarily defined solar cycle? </title><content type='html'>It's hard to believe that the Earth has completed almost five trips around the sun (at least, it will have by 19:44 this evening) since I started this blog, one boring Saturday afternoon in 2009. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Although I have been considerably less active over the past year, I still managed to find time for 18 posts.

It's mildly disappointing, but I'm actually glad that the world is taking privacy a little more seriously these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most popular posts for the year were, well, from previous years actually.

Other popular posts for the year include &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/03/amusing-hat-day.html"&gt;Amusing Hat Day&lt;/a&gt; (which was a bit of a flop - even I forgot my hat), and the posts about &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/02/favourite-classical-music.html"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; (lots of links to a couple hours worth of music, so go listen if you haven't already), the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/05/why-the-stars-are-not-long-dead.html"&gt;age of star light&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/01/theory-of-relativity.html"&gt;theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;. I was disappointed that my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/08/pagerip.html"&gt;first video game&lt;/a&gt; was not quite as successful (go download it and try it if you haven't. It's actually more fun than it sounds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of blogging, 2013 was a very eventful year. On the academic side, I actually made some serious progress toward my PhD (despite both a hard drive and a laptop deciding to retire, removing 700GB of simulations between them), and may actually finish it soon, and I was flown to the other side of the world (the USA) to present a paper at my third academic conference. I bought my first car (instead of just driving a car which technically belonged to my parents), and took out my first insurance policy. I think, somewhere during 2013, I turned into an adult. I'm still not exactly sure what that means, and I don't feel any different, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hopefully I'll still be able to find some time to post for some years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8876110872852517438/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8876110872852517438&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8876110872852517438'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8876110872852517438'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2014/01/on-fifth-arbitrarily-defined-solar-cycle.html' title='On... a fifth arbitrarily defined solar cycle?

Although that app is awesome for getting a sense of the sizes of various objects, it is not very good at conveying a sense of distance. To convey a sense of size and distance, you need to portray both sizes and distances to scale, like the Earth and Moon in the image below. I've always wondered if I could make something that can convey that sense of distance.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center; font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Earth-moon-to-scale.svg/500px-Earth-moon-to-scale.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Earth-moon-to-scale.svg/500px-Earth-moon-to-scale.svg.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure: The Earth and Moon with both sizes and distances to scale. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth-moon-to-scale.svg"&gt;[Source: Wikipedia]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been wanting to learn how to use HTML5 canvases and improve my JavaScript knowledge for a while, so I realised that this was a perfect opportunity to do that. On Christmas Eve 2013, I sat down and began to program it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/SolarSystem/"&gt;Here is what I came up with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/SolarSystem/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://sylvermyst.com/img/SolarSystem.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's probably not complete, but an app like this could be added to forever, and it possibly will be. I'd like to go further than our Solar System, and add some neighbouring stars, the Milky Way Galaxy and it's neighbours, and so on, until I get to the observable universe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this post will talk about the challenges I faced during development, so if that sort of thing doesn't interest you, you can move on. If it does, or you're bored enough not to care, then please read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the distances between objects in our Solar System are just enormous relative to the sizes of those objects. For example, to display the Earth and Sun together in an image, with the sizes and distances to scale, the image would have to be well over eleven thousand pixels across for the Earth to even show up as a single pixel. That's six times the resolution of a widescreen monitor at 1080p.&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is the range of orders of magnitude that need to be dealt with. Many moons in the solar system have diameters of just a few hundred kilometres and orbit tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometres from their planets, yet the gas giants orbit at distances of a few billion kilometres from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, there is the shear number of bodies in our solar system. The four gas giants have a couple hundred moons between them, and there are more than half a million bodies in our Solar System actively being tracked by the Minor Planet Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the orbit of each body in our solar system traces a unique path in three dimensional space, each with a different inclination, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters. Each body is at a different position in it's orbit, and many of these orbits (especially bodies in the outer solar system) intersect. For example, although Pluto is currently further from the sun than Neptune, it was actually closer than Neptune between 1979 and 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solutions described below were applied to solve the above problems, in reverse order. Each of these solutions has implications, which are also described below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program was restricted to a single dimension. Inclinations were ignored, and distance of each body is averaged across its entire orbit. The implication of this is that all bodies are incorrectly shown on the same plane, and distances between each body are completely inaccurate. Only the average distance from the body to the planet or star about which it orbits is accurate. A future incarnation of the program may remove this restriction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All eight major planets were included, but only the five dwarf planets recognised by the IAU at the time of writing were included. This means that some bodies such as Sedna, Quaoar, Orcus and Salacia were not included, even though they are widely considered by many astronomers to be dwarf planets. Moons are only included if they are either massive enough to be rounded under it's own gravity, or larger than 10% of their parent planet's diameter. There are only two exceptions: Mars's moons Phobos and Deimos. These were included because they are widely known, and are the best studied moons in our solar system other than our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to zoom was essential in order to get a sense of scale over a wider range of distances, with orders of magnitude varying from as little as tens of kilometres up to trillions and beyond. A constantly scaling grid in the background is essential for maintaining the sense of distance as the scale changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minimum size (currently 3 pixels) had to be enforced so that a bodies position could still be seen, even when zoomed too far out for it to be visible. Bodies gradually fade from view as they get too close to their parent bodies on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the final approach comes close to what I originally imagined when I originally came up with the idea, and I hope someone at least finds it interesting and educational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2408732615671696859/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2408732615671696859&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2408732615671696859'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2408732615671696859'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2014/01/solar-system.html' title='On a Sense of Scale in the Solar System'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3550301888638894754</id><published>2013-12-05T09:46:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-12-05T09:51:41.788+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='spaaaaaace'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sky'/><title type='text'>On Space and Big Life Decisions</title><content type='html'>I don't know why, but I've always assumed I'd be going to space one day, and I still know that I somehow will, one day. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; When I was very young, I wanted to be president of the world and rule from orbit. As I grew into a teenager, I began to understand a little of how politics worked, and I quickly abandoned that idea. Instead, I wanted to make my fortune by starting a multi-national corporation involved in every aspect of people's lives, and run a private space agency. I still hang on to that idea, and dream of it every now and then, but reality gets in the way. The business needs to start somewhere, and that needs a big idea. While I have no shortage of ideas, I have an unfortunate tendency to analyse them to shreds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was 15 or so when I realised I wanted to be an engineer. When I finished high school, for some reason I can't remember, I decided to pick a career based on the pay and how many job opportunities were available. Being South African, and having grown up in a city with a deep history in mining, I chose to become a metallurgical engineer on a mine. After 18 months at university, I couldn't figure out why I was doing what I was doing, but I was doing incredibly well academically, and I was waiting to hear back from the big mining company that had flown me out to a mine for a second round of interviews for a really attractive bursary. I felt that my entire future had been decided, and that I was stuck. It frustrated me. I told my mom how I felt in the car one day. I made it quite clear. If I did get the bursary, I'd carry on. But if I didn't get it, I wanted to study something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know what would have happened if I did get the bursary, or if my parents hadn't been so supportive, but I was lucky. At the beginning of the next year, I registered for a different degree, and a four years later, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering. I went straight into a Master's program, which brought me to where I am now - just a handful of months from finishing off my PhD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a couple of years late, but this is where I wanted to be when I was 15 years old. Then, of course, there's a few years of some sort of work, and then space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years of what work, exactly? It feels really weird to look back on things now and realise that I'd never really given it much thought. I kind of assumed that the right opportunity would come along, and I'd just go with it. And, to be honest, that's exactly what has always happened in the past, and I'm kind of waiting for it to happen again. For a while, I thought that I was stuck on the wrong continent, but of course, in Africa, there's no better place to be than South Africa. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:South_African_astronauts"&gt;Two South Africans&lt;/a&gt; have already been into space - one as a test pilot, and the other by copying my idea of becoming a stinking rich businessman. The past few years have even seen the start of &lt;a href="http://www.sansa.org.za/"&gt;a proper space agency&lt;/a&gt;, and the induction of &lt;a href="http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/denel-spaceteq-inducted-into-international-astronautical-federation-2013-09-23"&gt;a South African company into the International Astronautical Federation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm at another awkward point in my life where I have to decide where to go next. There are two things that I really enjoy doing, and want to do for the rest of my life: accumulating knowledge, and sharing that knowledge. I do really enjoy research (it's why I landed up doing my PhD), so I really would like some sort of R&amp;D job. But at the same time, I've sort of grown to like teaching. While a year ago, I thought I'd never want to be an academic, I now think that's a career I could really enjoy, especially if I'm allowed to take courses unrelated to my field on the side. But, how many academics get to go to space?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don't post enough pictures, so here's a picture of my giving a thumbs-up when I finally get into space, made using my very limited artistic talent. Yes, I know the stars are no where near as visible outside the atmosphere, but how else can I portray that I'm in space without the stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AexYkhng01M/UqAtcoGBpoI/AAAAAAAAAqA/PyoMkANkJFY/s1600/spaceman1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AexYkhng01M/UqAtcoGBpoI/AAAAAAAAAqA/PyoMkANkJFY/s1600/spaceman1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3550301888638894754/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3550301888638894754&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3550301888638894754'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3550301888638894754'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/12/spaaaaaace.html' title='On Space and Big Life Decisions'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AexYkhng01M/UqAtcoGBpoI/AAAAAAAAAqA/PyoMkANkJFY/s72-c/spaceman1.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5556075771857542910</id><published>2013-10-07T20:45:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-10-07T20:45:06.978+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><title type='text'>On Online Learning</title><content type='html'>There is probably a reason why, after 10 years, I'm still a university student. I can't say what it is, but I think I may be addicted to learning. At the beginning of the year, I discovered &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOCs&lt;/a&gt; (massive online open courses) through an article that randomly popped up on my Facebook feed. Eight months later, I've completed two courses through &lt;a href="https://www.edx.org"&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt;, and am on my way to finishing two more.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to the success of these courses, I find, are the entry surveys that they typically ask you to complete before the first lecture. One part of most of these surveys asks you to select a response to a series of sentences. The available responses go from "Not at all confident", through "Somewhat confident", to "Extremely confident". My reaction to these sentences often runs something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"I am confident that my English skills are sufficient for this course."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course. No doubt there. Extremely confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"I am confident I can understand the main concepts taught in this course."&lt;/i&gt; I'm doing a PhD in engineering. I should hope I can understand this. Extremely confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"I am confident that I can handle the assignments, the quizzes and tests in this MOOC."&lt;/i&gt; Once again, absolutely no doubt. It couldn't be much harder than anything I've handled before. Extremely confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"I am confident that I will finish the course."&lt;/i&gt; The slap in the face question. It gets me every time. It's like the arrogant "Oh yeah, then prove it" that I just can't back down from. Over the next few weeks, I will find myself working late on Sunday nights just to finish some assignment for a deadline the next morning, feeling like a complete undergrad, wondering why I ever signed up for this torture. Every time, I will think to myself, I could just quit. "There's no obligation to complete the course and earn a certificate", the FAQ constantly reminds me. But I don't quit, all because of that one time, right at the beginning of the course, that a survey used my ego to blackmail me into admitting that I was "somewhat confident" that I would finish the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5556075771857542910/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5556075771857542910&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5556075771857542910'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5556075771857542910'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/10/on-online-learning.html' title='On Online Learning'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1751731048576791456</id><published>2013-08-29T15:37:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-29T15:48:48.604+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the "Microsoft Service Center"</title><content type='html'>We regularly receive calls from people claiming to be from "Microsoft Service Center". Usually, I explain to them that I actually use Linux, and then rant on about how a computer technician should have at least heard of Linux until they hang up. Today, however, I decided to have some fun and see exactly what they wanted. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, its the stupid stuff. The internet is infected, apparently. Every time I connect, my computer starts downloading special viruses and trojans that can't be detected by normal anti-virus software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wanted me to run a command 'eventvwr'. This is just Window's built in system log viewer, and I know that it inevitably lists several errors and warnings. I told them I used Windows 98 on a very old desktop (keyword: "used"... a decade or so ago...), and that it was giving an error message telling me that the command was not found. After ten minutes of explaining to the guy that Microsoft made Windows 98 before XP, and that XP was not the first version of Windows, I finally got transferred to Dan, the senior technician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Dan says that ten or twelve years is not old for a computer. Computers have a lifespan of at least twenty years... Yeah, sure, Dan. Whatever you say.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan spoke nice and slow, so I pretended to type nice and slow too. He sent me to a website, which I did not recognise, so I told him so. Sounding frustrated, he told me that Microsoft has lots of websites and makes lots of products, and that Windows is just one of them, and this was another Microsoft website. I waited a little, and explained how the screen had gone red and said "This website is not trusted". He quickly told me to close it, and then slowly spelt out the website for TeamViewer, which is an address I do recognise (after a Google search, I now know that the first site he wanted to send me to was for remote desktop software as well). We waited five minutes while I pretend downloaded it, and apologised for having slow internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I don't know what it is. It's gotten really slow over the last few months," I told him. "Yes," he said. It's the trojan virus slowing it down. It's busy downloading all the other trojans onto your Windows."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I'd finished pretending to download TeamViewer, so he asked me to install it, but I could see where things were going. He wanted remote access to my PC, but I wasn't at my PC, so things were going to reach a stalemate. I decided it was about time for my pretend PC to crash. "Oh no, your computer hasn't crashed," he told me. "It's the hackers. They've taken control of your computer. Don't panic sir. I'll help you through this." Too bad. I panicked. I unplugged the modem on my imaginary desktop so the hackers wouldn't be able to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was where the guy began to offer some useful advice. "We're going to install Microsoft Security Essentials, sir." I told him how I already pay a fortune for an anti-virus package. Apparently, that doesn't do anything to stop hackers. But for only R 150, I could purchase Microsoft Security Essentials (which is actually free). All I needed was my credit card number. I could make the purchase right there and then, over the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credit Card? I used to get lots of calls trying to sell me stuff (they stopped completely when I registered on the Direct Marketing Association's &lt;a href="https://www.nationaloptout.co.za"&gt;National Opt Out Database&lt;/a&gt; over two years ago), so I know exactly how to stop this. I'm a student, I told him. I don't have a credit card. I do have a card, but it doesn't have an expiry date. It's not a Visa, it's not a Mastercard, and I can't use it to make payments over the phone. Beeep. Beeep Beeep. He'd hung up. Unfortunately. I was really having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1751731048576791456/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1751731048576791456&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1751731048576791456'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1751731048576791456'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/08/on-microsoft-service-centre.html' title='On the &quot;Microsoft Service Center&quot;'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-303381926365798860</id><published>2013-08-12T12:32:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2014-02-24T08:50:17.921+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='programming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='game development'/><title type='text'>On Video Game Programming - Part II: Page Ripping Champion 2013</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Back in May, I &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/05/on-video-game-programming.html"&gt;announced my intention to develop a game&lt;/a&gt;. I spent some time messing around with 3D engines, and was pretty happy with my progress. But then life and work got in the way, and it all ground to a halt. However, I did find time to lurk in the back of the last couple of meetings of the &lt;a href="http://www.makegamessa.com/"&gt;South African game development community&lt;/a&gt; (which is actually far more active and talented than I'd imagined). Last month, they ran a competition, with an actual deadline that motivated me to actually do something. The only constraint was that the game could only use two inputs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, &lt;/span&gt; I bring you a video game. No, it is not 3D, and actually has absolutely nothing to do with what I'd said I'd do, but it is more or less complete, relatively bug-free, and actually surprisingly enjoyable to play, if only for five minutes. I present to you: &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/PageRippingChamp/"&gt;Page Ripping Champion 2013!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/software/images/PageRip.png"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://sylvermyst.com/software/images/PageRip.png" width="520px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The player controls a pair of hands using the F and J keys and tries to pull out all 250 pages in a book. Points are awarded for good technique and deducted for bad technique. If you use a single hand for too long, then that hand cramps. If neither hand is moving, then all bonuses are dropped. If this happens too often, then it's game over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was written in &lt;a href="http://python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html"&gt;pygame&lt;/a&gt; for graphics, and &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/pgu/"&gt;PGU&lt;/a&gt; for the text. Graphics were very quickly thrown together in &lt;a href="http://inkscape.org/"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt;. The game runs on both Linux and Windows. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/303381926365798860/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=303381926365798860&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/303381926365798860'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/303381926365798860'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/08/pagerip.html' title='On Video Game Programming - Part II: Page Ripping Champion 2013'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2225900982159958882</id><published>2013-07-08T14:54:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-07-08T14:54:59.503+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On Reading</title><content type='html'>When I was in my first year of university, one of the lecturers handed out a survey. One of the questions asked how many books I read each year. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;I ran a quick calculation. At the time, my library membership allowed me to borrow up to six books at a time for a period of three weeks, but my father would let me take a couple extra books under his membership, since he rarely read. In total, I would take out between six and eight books at a time for three weeks each. Unfortunately, I did not usually read all of them. I would typically read about three or four, renew a couple, and remainder back unread. On average I was getting through just more than one book a week. From that,  &lt;/span&gt;I worked it out to be around 50 books a year, and that was a slightly conservative estimate. The following day, the lecturer showed us the results of the survey. In a class of over a hundred, I read the most. Someone else claimed to read thirty something books a year, and there were a few who read twenty something, but the vast majority read less than five books a year.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following year, the same lecturer came in to our class to give the survey again. This time, I answered thirty books a year. University had sapped away a lot of my spare time, and I was renewing all of my books over the phone on a regular basis. I was still ahead of anyone else in the class though, by a margin of about ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That second survey was about six years ago now. If I had to answer the same survey now, my answer would be less than ten. Sadly, I still think that puts me on the upper end of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People don't read anymore, and it's not a good thing. And I'm not just talking about books here. People don't read anything. In the last couple of decades, people like to say, the internet has made an impact on every aspect of our lives. But, of all of the information freely and readily available out there, how much have you read?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2225900982159958882&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2225900982159958882'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2225900982159958882'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5730706128633938412</id><published>2013-06-04T21:32:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-04T21:32:42.058+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='more or less nothing'/><title type='text'>On Being a Lecturer around Exam Time</title><content type='html'>My mind likes to work with concepts rather than images, so this blog does tend to be a little short on pictures.

High powered telescopes can look at stars that are millions, even billions, of light-years away. Because of this, a surprising number of people believe that when they look up into the sky, they are seeing stars as they were millions of years ago. Unfortunately, that's not true. In most cases, you're only seeing the star as it was a couple of centuries ago, or in many cases, only a couple of decades ago.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; In fact, if you look at Rigel Kent (the left most of the two pointers to the Southern Cross) tonight, you'd be seeing it as it was back in January 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, for more than half of the 50 brightest stars in the sky, the light reaching us now left them some time in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of ruins the popular anti-joke: "According to astronomy, when you wish upon a star, you're actually a few million years late. That star is dead. Just like your dreams." Pretty much all the stars we see are almost certainly still alive. The one that's expected to die the soonest is Betelgeuse (that's pronounced Beetlejuice), which we see as it was in the late 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Betelgeuse is due to explode any day now... Which in astronomical terms means some time in the next million or so years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you an idea of how long ago the light left some of the stars in the sky, I used &lt;a href="http://www.stellarium.org/"&gt;Stellarium&lt;/a&gt; to generate a map of the stars in the sky from Johannesburg, South Africa at 8 pm and 4 am last light. I've labelled most of the more prominent stars, and included the approximate date on Earth at which the light left the star. I didn't account for changes in calenders or anything, so some of the older dates may be a few days out, but it's still accurate enough to give you an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Johannesburg, 30 May 2013, 8PM:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRZGR3YGshU/Uahgwt-Cm2I/AAAAAAAAAmU/EvUTyzQOvf4/s1600/JHB+N+8PM.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRZGR3YGshU/Uahgwt-Cm2I/AAAAAAAAAmU/EvUTyzQOvf4/s540/JHB+N+8PM.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NDEkHK_Ar-o/Uahg0jM0dWI/AAAAAAAAAms/Rmfr9EY6Zkc/s1600/JHB+S+8PM.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NDEkHK_Ar-o/Uahg0jM0dWI/AAAAAAAAAms/Rmfr9EY6Zkc/s540/JHB+S+8PM.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Johannesburg, 31 May 2013, 4AM:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yDdKN7AP1d8/UahgyZ1Ec9I/AAAAAAAAAmg/xL_aLwvH8fs/s1600/JHB+N+4AM.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yDdKN7AP1d8/UahgyZ1Ec9I/AAAAAAAAAmg/xL_aLwvH8fs/s540/JHB+N+4AM.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bivYu0Kl12c/UahgyINVctI/AAAAAAAAAmc/qM8Hw5HrMp8/s1600/JHB+S+4AM.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bivYu0Kl12c/UahgyINVctI/AAAAAAAAAmc/qM8Hw5HrMp8/s540/JHB+S+4AM.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, you can click on the images for a higher resolution version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the constellation of Orion (of which Betelgeuse makes up the armpit) disappeared over the horizon shortly after sunset, so it was not visible for very long last night. For the briefest instant at around 4AM, the very dim Mu Cephei would have popped above the northern horizon if you had a clear enough view. Mu Cephei is one of the largest and most luminous stars in our galaxy, and yet it's barely visible with the naked eye. Light from Mu Cephei travels a mere 6000 years to reach us. If you think that's a long time, consider that light takes 100 000 years to travel from one side of the Milky Way to the other, and about 2.5 million years to get from here to our neighbouring galaxy, Andromeda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8238065311794970972/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8238065311794970972&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8238065311794970972'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8238065311794970972'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/05/why-the-stars-are-not-long-dead.html' title='On Why the Stars We See in the Sky are NOT Long Dead'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRZGR3YGshU/Uahgwt-Cm2I/AAAAAAAAAmU/EvUTyzQOvf4/s72-c/JHB+N+8PM.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7390519706029786773</id><published>2013-05-22T21:09:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2014-01-13T09:15:53.044+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='programming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video game mechanics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='game development'/><title type='text'>On Video Game Programming</title><content type='html'>I haven't really had much time in the last few years to spend time programming something for fun, and I think it's really starting to get to me. In an attempt to fix this, I've set myself a fairly ambitious goal. I'm going to attempt to program a fully functional 3D game, or at least a working prototype of one.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The catch is that I'd like to release the game under a &lt;a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;GNU General Public Licence&lt;/a&gt;, or something similar, and so any libraries or engines that I use need to be compatible with that licence. Even so, I'm strictly limiting myself to using only free and open source software to develop the game. That means I'm not even going to use my Windows laptop to make backups. The game will stay strictly between my Linux netbook and desktop (This is also to prevent me from being tempted to do anything on this project while I'm at work). However, I'd like the final game to be cross-platform if I ever release it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. My Game Programming History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with creating games is fairly limited. I completed my first "real" PC game about 10 years ago. It was a simple text-based fighter with a combat system fairly similar to that of the Game Boy's Pokemon games. I've made a couple of attempts at games since - all ridiculously simple - a vertically scrolling space shooter (where balls start falling from the sky that get progressively faster), a pointless game where you control a grim reaper figure and try herd one of several balls into various baskets on variously shaped fields. One of the most promising games I've made was a horizontal scrolling platform game inspired by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)"&gt;Contra&lt;/a&gt;. You controlled a figure that resembled the guy from the toilet signs (I'm sorry. I drew all the sprites pixel-by-pixel in MS Paint), and the object was to make your way through the rooms of some form of hostile building. I finished the first level, started prototypes for the second and third, and realised that I had no clue about balancing difficulty. The result was... well, it's probably better if you just &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/software/#trooperman"&gt;try it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. The Concept&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what am I going to try and make now? The concept is one that I think is really simple to implement. I want something that makes use of (at least approximtely) real life physics, but in an environment that is completely unfamiliar. I want people with an understanding of physics to be able to understand the game mechanics, but I want a person who works off of everyday experience to be thrown off, and hopefully spark a curiosity as to why things happen that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to physics, there are two phenomena that more or less govern all of our intuition when it comes to judging how things behave. Those two phenomena are gravity and physical resistance (be it friction, air resistance, whatever). So, getting rid of these two things will change the way everything behaves, and the behaviour will be physically possible, yet completely unfamiliar. You can see where I'm going with this. The game will be set in space. Or at least, on a space station in space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager, I played a game called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)"&gt;Descent&lt;/a&gt;. While I was never particularly good at the game, the game's unconventional use of 3D movement in an enclosed zero-gravity environment stuck with me. I was always fascinated with the way my mind would always pick a direction as "down" based on visual clues, and I would always needlessly try and orient my ship in that direction, even wasting time during combat to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read Orson Scott Card's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_game"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I could not help remembering playing Descent, always needing to orient myself according to those visual clues. "Remember- the enemy’s gate is down" is a well known quote from the book - and refers to the fact that ignoring the visual clues, and over riding your instinct with a different concept of direction could give you a strategic advantage. I always wondered about how it would feel if I was in a Battle Room, with no ability to change direction or velocity until I touch an object, and with no sure way to stop myself. I've always toyed with the idea of programming something based on that concept. I've finally decided that I will make it into a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum it up, the game will consist of a room, with obstacles, in which players will float free from any effects of gravity or air resistance. The only means of controlling ones motion will be through physical interaction with the walls, obstacles, and other players. In this, I will incorporate a combat element, and hopefully later a team combat element, as well as a certain level of puzzle solving. I don't want to take the concept too far until I see how everything works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. Starting Off&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Programming a game is not easy. There are a lot of aspects that need to be taken care of, and the one thing that's always stood in my way is not knowing where to begin. In the past, I've falling into the trap of designing the GUI, the main menu, writing the help files, character design, and all the wrong things to start with. I know where to begin now. A prototype. I need a rectangular room with a sphere, and very basic camera controls. I can then make the sphere move, and then make it bounce off walls. Then I can worry about adding controls to allow the player to control how the sphere bounces. Once I've got that, I'll have a basic prototype. I'll then start thinking about how to add other players. Only once I have that am I going to try put in models, textures, a GUI, and all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;4. The Language Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I need to decide is what language I'm going to write the game in. This section is going to have to start with a bit of a rant, and I apologise for that. Without a doubt, Python is my favourite language. Despite criticisms against it, it's actually not such a terrible language to use to make a decent game. The one thing I hate though is the general attitude some people seem to have toward Python. "Its slow because it's a scripting language!" It can be used as a scripting language, but it's got so many other uses. Also, it can call C libraries, which is almost as fast as if the entire game was written in C/C++ anyway. "But Python sucks with graphics!" Yes, but once again, C libraries... Personally, I can write code far quicker in Python than in any other language I've dealt with, and it's not just because I've got more Python experience. I also get fewer bugs with Python, and I find those bugs easier to find. I've often written a quick Python program to do menial tasks. I've never written a C++ code for anything other than university projects, and even then, I only used C++ because the choice of language was made for me. I'm not a big fan of C++. I love almost everything about Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact remains, if I Google some problem I'm having in Python, I land up with a forum post swamped with useless comments like "learn a real language" and the like, even though the real solution is usually some really elegant and concise line of code, and it really gets on my nerves. When I Google the same problem for C++, I get several civilised answers on how to go about solving my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for that reason, and because of the game engines available, I'm going to be programming this game in C++. Although I've read through and made minor modifications to bits of C++ code in the last couple of years, it's about 6 years since I did any serious C++ programming from scratch, but hopefully I'll pick it up quickly again. &lt;a href="http://projecteuler.net/"&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; time again, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;5. The Engine Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I also mentioned that I'd be using C++ because of the engines available. If I was using Windows, I'd probably use Unity. I've heard a lot of good things about Unity, but it doesn't meet the constraints that I've set myself. I need something with a decent free software licence, and preferably something that works nicely on Ubuntu. The first engine I started looking into was &lt;a href="http://www.panda3d.org/"&gt;Panda3D&lt;/a&gt;. It's a 3D library for Python, made available under a &lt;a href="http://www.panda3d.org/license.php"&gt;modified BSD license&lt;/a&gt;. However, after a week of messing around with it, I found it clumsy and messy. I also found it difficult to learn. The closest thing I could find to a tutorial are a set of poorly commented sample programs, which I had to manually read through to find what was relevant to what I wanted to do. I grew frustrated quickly and decided to start looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a surprising number of 3D engines out there, but very few work well with Python. Once I broadened my search to include engines for other languages, I had better luck. I eventually settled on &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/"&gt;OGRE&lt;/a&gt;, which is made available under an &lt;a href="http://ogre.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ogre/trunk/COPYING"&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to have a decent set of tutorials available. The advantage of OGRE is that it apparently works quite well with &lt;a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;, an open source physics engine that looks like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty sure this project will take me a while. It's possibly one of the most ambitious projects I've ever undertaken. That said, I'm hoping that once I get some sort of working prototype, the rest will be easy. I've written this for three reasons. The first is to get my plans down in a coherent form that I can follow. It forces me to iron out the concept, in a way that can be explained simply, and this gives me a solid foundation on which to start developing. Secondly, it makes a commitment that I will do this. It gives me some level of accountability, and hopefully my readers will remind me if I forget about the project (although, that's never really worked in the past). Thirdly, it exposes my idea to much needed criticism. If you have any improvements to the idea, or if you think it's rubbish and I should do something else altogether, please tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7390519706029786773/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7390519706029786773&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7390519706029786773'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7390519706029786773'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/05/on-video-game-programming.html' title='On Video Game Programming'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2546026475754506953</id><published>2013-04-30T09:49:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-04-30T09:49:14.799+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On Why Resigning is not Usually the Honourable Thing</title><content type='html'>Recent events in the news have lead to certain people saying "She should just resign and let someone else take over," and "at least he did the honourable thing and stepped down." I've always thought that resigning is precisely the opposite of the honourable thing. This is best explained with an analogy. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a party at someone's house. Things get a little out of hand, and someone is being stupid, messing around, doing stuff that they probably shouldn't be doing, and eventually, somehow, a table with several glasses and drinks gets sent flying. Imagine that you're the host, and you're staring down the culprit. If he said, "Sorry, here's some cash to cover the cost of the glasses, and where's the mop so I can help you clean up?", would that be the honourable thing? What if he said, "I'm not saying I'm the one who knocked over the table, but I'm going home"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another example. Imagine you have a daughter, and she winds up pregnant, and you weren't even aware that she was even seeing anyone, but you've got a pretty good idea who the father is. If this boy says "I may or may not have gotten your daughter pregnant," and then leaves town, is that really the honourable thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I'm trying to say is that we shouldn't be calling for people to resign in the face of a scandal. We should be calling for people to take responsibility, and fix whatever mess they've created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2546026475754506953/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2546026475754506953&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2546026475754506953'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2546026475754506953'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/04/resigning-is-not-honourable.html' title='On Why Resigning is not Usually the Honourable Thing'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3940258122209358565</id><published>2013-04-23T11:58:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-04-23T11:58:32.193+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>I can't help but get the feeling that other people are wasting their lives, and I just don't know &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3940258122209358565&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3940258122209358565'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3940258122209358565'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8228140999514704907</id><published>2013-04-23T11:56:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-04-23T11:56:59.417+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Why I Dislike Being Complimented</title><content type='html'>Nothing saddens me more than being told that I'm somehow "cleverer" than others, or being told that &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8228140999514704907&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8228140999514704907'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8228140999514704907'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8859516028949904753</id><published>2013-04-23T11:54:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-04-23T11:54:46.881+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On A Final Moment</title><content type='html'>"So. This is how it ends," thought Michael. The thought filled his conciousness, erasing everything else. It was accompanied, surprisingly, with by a distant sense of calm, unambiguous finality. The analysis of the whole situation was entirely subconscious, giving rise to that one single thought. He was  more aware than ever of the looming headlights emerging from the swirling maelstrom of water and ice that buffeted his car as it gracefully glode driver's side first down the hill.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  He was aware of the two glowing orbs slowly turning away as the other vehicle made some attempt at swerving that sent it into an elegent pirouette that mirrored Michael's own. He was also more fully aware than ever of his own mind, completely aware that he could sense his mind as if it belonged to someone else, aware of that single isolated mind containing absolutely nothing but that one single thought. No memories of past events, no regrets of decisions made, no pride over anything earned in life. Nothing but that one single thought which seemed to go on forever, "So. This is how it ends," until it finally ended with a single harmonious sound: "Crunch!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What felt like both that same instant and an eternity later, Michael was aware of his mind gradually waking up. He seemed an external observer, somehow sensing the growing presence of his own mind as the time passed, but nothing else. He saw nothing, heard nothing, felt nothing. Even the familiar awareness of his own body seemed to be missing. He was merely a mind floating in nothingness. Gradually, the mind began pulling together coherent thoughts, fearful thoughts, although putting those thoughts into words proved impossible. Had he been able to put words to his thoughts, they would have read along the lines of "Is it just this for eternity?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For just an instant, he felt the overwhelmingly convincing presence of a second mind within his own, which left a memory just as clear as if a loud voice full of power and confidence had just announced unambiguously: "No."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, he knew that the thought was not his own. He struggled to pull thoughts together to call it back, but he was struggling to arrange his thoughts into structured sentences. All he could manage were sequences of vague concepts and sensations. With some effort, he managed to gathered all of his thoughts into a single sensation - confusion.  Something along the lines of "Where am I? What is going on? Why can't I think properly?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second mind reappeared momentarily, and left him with the clear wordless thoughts: "What do you mean by '&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;'? You are dead, you no longer have a body. Your lone mind does not have the tools needed to form concious thoughts. Like most people, you made thinking easier by voicing your thoughts inside your head. You forced language structure onto your thoughts, you visualised your thoughts, you imagined you could touch them. You sensed them. Those were all things that you did as a living being, that you needed to do to stay alive. You limited your mind to thinking only in the simplest way that would allow you to live. You took your subconscious thoughts for granted, and did not bother trying to control them. It will take time to learn to understand your pure thoughts again, but you have all the time you need. There is no decay here."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael knew that these clear thoughts were not his own. He gathered his thoughts once more. "I'm dead. Are you God?" He felt that he already knew the answer. The second mind sent him a thought of confident affirmation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You must know already, but I wasn't expecting this. I stopped believing in you when I was twelve."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I know. But the fact that you are experiencing this fills you with only with curiosity. Those who are expecting it are usually filled with nervousness and fear. I will now tell you everything you want to know all, but it will take time. If you are aware of a question, you will also be aware of the answer."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Will I be judged now?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I know every thought you have ever had and every thought that you are yet to have. There is no need to set aside a specific time for judgement. You were judged the moment I thought you into existence."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I don't understand. So my actions and choices in life had no bearing on your judgement?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Of course they did. But already knew your choices and actions. I have also always known why you would take those choices, even when you weren't so sure yourself. You have free will though. You have always been free to  make your own choices. But I've always known which choices you would make."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly, Michael was getting used to directing and controlling his thoughts. There was one thing he needed to know. He finally pushed forward the one thought that had been the single question that had driven him in life. "What's the meaning of it all?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am the meaning. It happens because I wanted it to."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But if you already know everything that's going to happen, why do you need to actually go through with it. Don't you get bored?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I cannot be bored."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael was aware that a response like that would have triggered a smug feeling, something along the lines of "If you can't be bored then you're not omnipotent." The comment seemed so stupid now, expressed as a concept alone, with no words to carry exact meanings."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You're starting to understand the power of thinking without a body to project your thoughts into," came the thought from God.

Everything in that universe is exactly like ours in every way except that, technologically, the inhabitants are around ten thousand years behind us. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;Luckily, their languages have magically and inexplicably managed to evolve the same ways as ours, so they understand everything you tell them, and you understand everything they tell you. They've got a pretty good idea of how to start fires, make sharp tools, and they're not too bad with farming, but they have little more than that. &lt;/span&gt;While their quaint rural lifestyle would probably seem nice and relaxing for the first few days, no doubt you'd start to miss some of your modern comforts after a while. You have all the knowledge of a late twentieth/early twenty-first century education. How much of ten millennia worth of technological advancement could you reproduce in the remainder of your lifetime?&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. So... What am I starting from?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets set the stage. We're talking the equivalent of roughly 8000 BCE in our world, which is the middle of the Neolithic Era. People are still using stone tools - this is about a thousand years before the first copper came on the scene (and about three thousand more before it's use is widespread), bronze tools are still five thousand years away, and iron tools will only start appearing a couple thousand years after that. However, they're getting quite advanced with stone technology. They're not just bashing rocks until they have a sharp point any more. They're taking the time to grind and polish their tools, and getting pretty good at it too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Domestic dogs, sheep, and pigs are pretty widespread, but the idea of domesticated cattle is a fairly new one. Farming plants is also a pretty new idea, and is mainly limited to annuals like pulses, grains and gourds. If you want fruit, you'd most likely have to find a wild tree or bush. There are lots of farms, and a handful of villages. There are even a couple of towns in the most developed parts of the world - with walls and towers and everything - although they only have a few thousand inhabitants each. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having to go hunting for food actually frees up a surprising amount of time, and these people are just starting to discover recreation. They're already carving crude statues and making jewellery from brightly coloured stones, but concepts like wheels and pottery are still 1500 years away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. Why would I be able to contribute?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I supposedly have all the knowledge that comes from being educated in the last decade of the twentieth century. I have an engineering degree from the first decade of the twenty-first century. Lets assume that I'm a quick enough negotiator so that they don't consider me a threat and kill me, and that I somehow manage to convince them to listen to me. What can I offer to this backward civilisation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. The Basics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the wheel is a pretty obvious place to start. I could also teach them them that mud can be used for more than just mud huts and teach them to use clay to do some basic pottery. Not that I'm particularly knowledgeable about pottery, but I'm sure I could convey some of the basic ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another obvious, and probably essential technology would be writing. They'd actually be about five thousand years away from inventing written language on their own. However, starting with very young children, and trying to mimic the methods that are used in millions of our own schools across the world, I feel I could have children reading, writing and understanding within about six to eight years. Following on from that, I see no reason why I couldn't introduce a crude wooden printing press, even though they're almost nine and a half thousand years from inventing it on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once that's out the way, a crash course in Western philosophy may be appropriate. It would be wonderful if I could somehow get deductive logic to be a permanent feature in the education system from the very start. And naturally, I could follow with mathematics. I feel that with my knowledge, I could teach them basic arithmetic, quite a bit of algebra, some introductory statistics, and I think it may even be a good idea to introduce some very elementary calculus. Of course, I'd have to start teaching some Newtonian mechanics to make it all make sense, and then I could teach them some basic engineering design to make it all useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think I'd have to teach ethics from very early on. In fact, I should probably lead with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;4. What Could I Contribute From &lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; Education?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... I did spend two years in university specialising in metallurgy. Is that useful at all? They're not far off from working out how much you can do with copper. I could easily teach them everything they need to know to build a simple clay copper smelter, and how to work the copper to make tools. I could even bypass the whole copper age, and show them how to introduce tin to make bronze. I could tell them all about alloys, and how you can affect the properties of metals by mixing them in different ratios. There's one catch though, and it's a fairly big and embarrassing one. I actually have no idea how to differentiate copper ore in a pile of rock. I wouldn't be able to identify any metal ore, in fact. So unless they know what copper ore is, but just haven't figured out what to use it for, none of my metallurgy knowledge is going to be particularly useful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the following four years studying aeronautical engineering. Obviously they're not quite ready for aircraft, but there are some pretty important things I could teach them that they could put to immediate use. Windmills are incredibly useful for grinding grain. I could also probably teach them a bit about propellants, and maybe make some crude rockets, but I'm not sure if this would be a good idea. In fact, most of what I could teach them from my university education would have only military uses to a civilisation like theirs. I think I should most definitely lead with teaching them ethics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;5. What Would Actually Happen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course of events that would actually take place becomes pretty obvious, the more I think about it. I would arrive in their world. I would encounter the first tribe, and convince them not to kill me. Knowing people, I'd presumably have to do this by demonstrating that I can provide some military advantage over their rivals. They'd be terrified that I'd be captured by their rivals, so they'd kill me to prevent my knowledge falling into the wrong hands. Progress would resume as if I'd never been there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #4070e0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;6. Conclusion - What &lt;i&gt;Should&lt;/i&gt; I Do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is simple. Remain isolated. Live as a hermit. Avoid all contact with the humans that inhabit that planet. Never reveal anything. Unfortunately, I'm too much of a show off, so even then, I'd probably try something stupid and get myself killed. So the safest thing to do is to avoid being transported to a universe whose human inhabitants are ten thousand years behind ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you do? What could you contribute?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;b&gt;Editor's note: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proof-reading this post made me realise that it sounds like a very generic blog topic. In fact, it probably sounds like it came straight from a random writing prompt. It didn't. As usual, I've probably been playing too much Minecraft, and it got me thinking. This is not too far off what that game is all about.&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4561668018416001972/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4561668018416001972&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4561668018416001972'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4561668018416001972'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/04/build-society-from-scratch.html' title='On What I Could Contribute if I had to Build Society from Scratch'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5131285268978333980</id><published>2013-03-20T15:31:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-03-20T15:31:10.602+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video game mechanics'/><title type='text'>On The Air Flow Implications of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device</title><content type='html'>In &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;Valve Corporation's first-person puzzle games, &lt;/span&gt;Portal and Portal 2, the player is made to solve a series of puzzles by opening a pair of portals on various flat surfaces, providing a means of instantly transporting the player and objects across the games' environments. Momentum is conserved when travelling through the portals, and this is an important mechanic throughout both games. But, if air can flow through the portals &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;(for definitive proof, see final scene of Portal 2)&lt;/span&gt;, then what happens to the air flow patterns in the room? &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. Portal Properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No physics textbook will tell you the details of how these portals behave. Instead, we're going to have to assume some of the details about how the portals operate. Here's a list of what I believe the significant properties of the portals are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Portals are elliptical, with a major axis of roughly 2m, and minor axis of roughly 1m. This means that the portal area is about 2π m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Portals open from the centre outwards, take roughly half a second to open, and only operate once fully open. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They can be oriented at any angle, and momentum of an object passing through is rotated by the difference in angles between the two portals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Gravitational fields do not pass through the portals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. What Would Cause the Air to Flow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer, put simply, is gravity. Well, actually, the air flows because of a difference in pressure, but the difference in pressure occurs due to gravity. Imagine you have a polystyrene cup filled with water. The surface of the water is at ambient atmospheric pressure, but the water at the bottom of the cup is being pushed down by the weight of all of the water above it. Because of it, the water pressure at the bottom of the cup is 1% higher than the water at the surface. Now poke a hole in the bottom of the cup. Because there's a different pressure on either side of the hole (atmospheric pressure outside, and 1% higher than that inside), the water's going to flow out the cup until the pressure equalises. This happens once the water level drops to the same level as the hole, and at that point, no more water will flow out the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, so what happens if we catch all of this water flowing out the bottom and pump it back into the cup. The pressure will never equalise, and we'll quickly reach a situation where we have a steady downward current in the cup. That's no different to having all the air flowing out a portal at the bottom of a room, and immediately being reintroduced through a portal at the top of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weight of the water above increases the pressure at the bottom of the cup, then why doesn't the pressure outside the cup increase from the weight of the air above it? In fact, it does. It's just that, since a given volume of water is about a thousand times heavier than the same volume of air, the weight of the air over the height of the cup is insignificant. In fact, while the water pressure at the bottom of the cup was 1% higher, the air pressure outside the cup is only 0.001% higher. However, if we look at the height of rooms within the games (take a height of 20m as the maximum), we're dealing with pressure differences a couple hundred times higher than we had outside the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. Opening a Portal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where things get interesting. If you've got two separate containers of air, with two different pressures, and you instantaneously remove whatever it is that is separating them, you generate a shock wave, which moves into the region with the lower pressure, and an expansion wave which moves into the region with a higher pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5131285268978333980&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5131285268978333980'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5131285268978333980'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3801580694501475769</id><published>2013-03-11T21:49:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-03-13T21:42:19.044+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Amusing Hat Day'/><title type='text'>On Amusing Hat Day for Incompetence Awareness 2013</title><content type='html'>Incompetence can be cured, if only we'd all make the effort.

Somewhere along the line, being incompetent became something to be ashamed of. All to often, we belittle people for something they can't do. Quite frankly, that's half the problem. Being incompetent is not something that anyone does deliberately. Many incompetent people are too embarrassed to admit that they don't know what they are doing. More often, they're not even aware of their incompetence. If only these people could be made aware of their shortcomings so that they could take steps to learn. So often, an incompetent person needs nothing more than to be taken by the hand and taught how to teach themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, awareness can only go so far. Somewhere along the line, we also need to start doing something. If you have any spare books lying around, then donate them to a local library or school. Offer your services to help out at a school or children's home. If you have no books, and are too busy to help, then donate some money to an orphanage, and let them know you want it to go towards a child's education. If you have no money, then use your creativity. Wear your amusing hat, and if anyone asks about it, use the opportunity to ask them to help out too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we all work together, we can solve the problem of global incompetence, and with it, the vast majority of the worlds other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3801580694501475769/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3801580694501475769&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3801580694501475769'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3801580694501475769'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/03/amusing-hat-day.html' title='On Amusing Hat Day for Incompetence Awareness 2013'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OtgkQ6qGfl8/UT4ziNnf9uI/AAAAAAAAAls/5-85ZaaSUyo/s72-c/23884_10151519925571745_1633133464_n.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1893687667853424104</id><published>2013-03-05T12:24:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-03-05T12:24:46.514+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><title type='text'>On Why South Africans Don't Really Mind Petrol Price Hikes</title><content type='html'>South Africans love to complain, but I never see their words affect their actions. Sure the petrol price has an obvious affect on how much you land up paying to fill up your tank, but there are other factors that influence it too. Its difficult to take someone seriously if they complain about the petrol price after they've just bought an SUV, and even more so when you watch cars flying past on the highway at 140km/h&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;. If people were really concerned about the price of petrol, we'd see people buying smaller cars, and driving slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's all very well to say this, but I'm basing it all on anecdotal evidence. It &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; as if people are driving the same speed, and it &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; that they're still buying larger cars, but what do the actual figures say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that no one in South Africa regularly reports statistics on traffic related charges. In fact, apart from a single report for KZN in 2007, I could not find anything about the number of speeding fines issued in a given period. Unfortunately, this means that my impression that people are driving just as fast as they were a few years ago will have to remain unconfirmed. However, we do have data on vehicle sales and the petrol price, so we'll just have to concentrate on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Fuel Prices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's quite easy to find out past fuel prices. The AA of South Africa kindly lists &lt;a href="http://www.aa.co.za/on-the-road/calculator-tools/fuel-pricing.html"&gt;past fuel prices&lt;/a&gt; for each month going back to 2008. The fuel price, as you're probably aware, has been steadily increasing over over that entire period. The exact value of the fuel price depends on whether it is sold at the coast or inland, and on the octane rating, but since I live inland and use 93 octane fuel, I used that price. Whichever price you choose to look at, however, the trend remains exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Vehicle Sales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data on vehicle sales is a little harder to find. The National Association of Automobile Manufactures of South Africa (&lt;a href="http://www.naamsa.co.za/"&gt;NAAMSA&lt;/a&gt;) publishes vehicle sales data, broken down by manufacturer. The catch is that their &lt;a href="http://www.naamsa.co.za/flash/portal.asp"&gt;public access "Flash Results"&lt;/a&gt; are the only freely available results that they publish, and they don't seem to keep data for previous months. Fortunately, our old friend Google does. There are a number of sites that publish the NAAMSA flash reports from time to time, and so using search phrases like &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/#q=inurl:pdf+naamsa+%22new+vehicle+sales+statistics%22+may+2011"&gt;"inurl:pdf naamsa 'new vehicle sales statistics' may 2011"&lt;/a&gt;, I managed to find a complete record going back to January 2009. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These reports include a breakdown of sales by engine size for Associated Motor Holdings (Hyundai, Kia, etc.), and as of July 2009, Amalgamated Automobile Distributors (Chana, Foton, etc.). While ideally I'd like to include a lot more manufacturers in my analysis, and the reports do contain more detailed sales data for most other manufacturers, these figures don't help me unless they are combined and aggregated - a classic case of too much information being useless. (Of course, I could do this manually, but that would take too much time. I could also pay for access to more detailed information which just might contain the aggregated data I'm looking for, but I'd feel cheated if I paid for something which was essentially public information anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to get an indication of the market, we'll look at the combined AMH and AAD sales for the following four categories: small (1400cc or less), medium (more than 1400cc, up to 2500cc), and large (more than 2500cc) cars, and SUVs and 4x4 recreational vehicles. For reference, these figures cover roughly 10% of the total monthly sales for all manufacturers in South Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Effect of Petrol Price on Small Vehicle Sales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, if people are smart and don't like spending a lot on petrol, we'd expect to see them buying more small cars as the petrol price increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vehicle sales fluctuate wildly from month to month, but we're not concerned at this point with total sales. We just want to know what portion of those sales were small cars. So we simply take the number of cars with an engine size of 1400cc or less and divide by the total sales in the four categories (and naturally multiply by 100 to get a percentage). Since there's a bit of a fluctuation from month to month, we smooth the data out into a three month average. To keep things balanced, we compare this to the change in petrol price over the three months. The data is plotted below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paX2oig2Y0Q/UTWzVyoVChI/AAAAAAAAAk8/bZK0nF6W0c0/s1600/petrol+price+and+perc+small+cars+v+month.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paX2oig2Y0Q/UTWzVyoVChI/AAAAAAAAAk8/bZK0nF6W0c0/s800/petrol+price+and+perc+small+cars+v+month.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Apart from the obviously steadily increasing petrol price, you can see that there's a definite seasonal fluctuation in the number of small cars purchased. There's a definite peak between October and March. I'd guess this is due to year-end bonuses and school leavers entering the vehicle market, but that's not really important. What is important is that if you ignore these seasonal variations, there is a definite &lt;i&gt;downward&lt;/i&gt; trend. So while the petrol price is increasing, people are favouring medium to larger cars over the smaller cars - the complete opposite of what you'd expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we take time out, and simply plot the 3 month sales figures against the 3 month change in fuel price, we see the picture a little more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZmqM4IR8d0c/UTW3jOaY0eI/AAAAAAAAAlM/PO3oyPhxjKI/s1600/perc+small+cars+v+petrol+price.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZmqM4IR8d0c/UTW3jOaY0eI/AAAAAAAAAlM/PO3oyPhxjKI/s800/perc+small+cars+v+petrol+price.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's obviously no linear relationship (for those who know their stats, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 0.00006), but if we try fit a trend anyway, we see that it comes out more or less flat - implying that the petrol price has very little effect on the percentage of small cars bought. Of course, in reality, this is not necessarily the case. It is more likely that there are other factors which buyers consider more important that petrol price when they're deciding what car to buy. Things like the state of the economy at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Effect of the Economy on Small Vehicle Sales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gross domestic product (GDP) is a pretty well recognised indicator of the state of a country's economy. Unfortunately, monthly GDP values are not published, but quarterly ones are. This suits us fine, because we're looking at sales date averaged over three months anyway. Lets plot the percentage of small cars sales against the GDP and see what happens. (Since the actual value of the GDP is not important, it's been normalised by dividing by the GDP at the start of our data - i.e. June 2009)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rX4ESVeX9lo/UTW-TSO0PhI/AAAAAAAAAlc/gdR6kI9lwVM/s1600/perc+small+cars+v+gdp.png" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rX4ESVeX9lo/UTW-TSO0PhI/AAAAAAAAAlc/gdR6kI9lwVM/s800/perc+small+cars+v+gdp.png" width="540px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scatter is primarily caused by the seasonal fluctuation I mentioned earlier. If we ignore that, we see a definite downward trend. As the GDP increases, we see people favouring medium to larger cars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people were concerned about the petrol price, we'd expect to see people favouring cars with smaller engines as the petrol price climbs, but we actually see the exact opposite behaviour. The country's economy is growing steadily at the moment, and the immediate future looks bright (because who thinks long term anyway), so who really cares how much it costs to fill up your tank?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me? I drive a small car, and I've always made an effort to drive it economically. But I don't have much money to spare, and I realised long ago that I just don't think of things the way others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1893687667853424104/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1893687667853424104&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1893687667853424104'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1893687667853424104'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/03/petrol-price.html' title='On Why South Africans Don&apos;t Really Mind Petrol Price Hikes'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paX2oig2Y0Q/UTWzVyoVChI/AAAAAAAAAk8/bZK0nF6W0c0/s72-c/petrol+price+and+perc+small+cars+v+month.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8150654967514820227</id><published>2013-02-28T14:51:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-02-28T14:51:44.853+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On My 13 Favourite Pieces of Classical Music</title><content type='html'>I felt like compiling another list of music I enjoy. I'm told that I listen to a fairly broad range of music, but I don't really. All of the music I really enjoy falls into the genres of metal, alternative rock and classical, and even within those genres, I'm quite discerning. Anyway, here is a list of the 13 pieces of classical music that I would list as my favourite&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;, in no particular order. It wasn't easy, but I did try limit myself to listing each composer only once&lt;/span&gt;. Sit back, listen, and enjoy.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGdFHJXciAQ"&gt;Vivaldi's "Winter" from &lt;i&gt;The Four Seasons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi"&gt;Antonio Vivaldi's&lt;/a&gt; music was incredibly advanced for it's time. Although it is a full concerto in it's own right (No. 4 in F minor), it is usually listed as the final part of the set &lt;i&gt;The Four Seasons&lt;/i&gt;. The first concerto, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4kTei0XrCs"&gt;"Spring"&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most famous (and you'd probably recognise the opening bars if you heard them), but of the four, it is definitely the one I like least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsouEMV4Pb8"&gt;The Funeral March from Mahlers's Symphony No. 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler"&gt;Gustav Mahler&lt;/a&gt; wrote a couple of funeral marches throughout his life. The first, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z8y1K0DLdo"&gt;"Hunter's Funeral"&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the third movement of his first symphony is probably one you'd recognise - the melody is from the nursery rhyme &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_you_sleeping"&gt;"Are You Sleeping?"&lt;/a&gt;. The opening movement of his 5th symphony, however, is far more powerful. It portrays such complex emotion, more than just the sadness which funeral marches tend to carry. It contains pieces which carry grief, distress, frustration, resignation, and gratefulness all pulled together in a single piece of music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IRMYuE1hI"&gt;Beethoven's &lt;i&gt;Symphony No. 5&lt;/i&gt;, Movement I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven's&lt;/a&gt; 5th symphony is one of the most famous pieces of classical music ever written. I enjoy the majority of Beethoven's work from his middle period, but his fifth symphony (together with the more light hearted &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr3lsI4OVis"&gt;eighth symphony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moonlight Sonata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) really stands out from the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vXuVBd99k4"&gt;Dvořák's &lt;i&gt;New World Symphony&lt;/i&gt;, Movement IV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k"&gt;Antonín Dvořák's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;From the New World&lt;/i&gt; was apparently one of the pieces of music that Neil Armstrong chose to take with him to the moon. As far as epic music goes, the final movement is one of the best. Having been a big fan of this piece for years, I was incredibly excited when I first heard &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L95MNCQzD-A"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wizard's Last Rhymes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (by the Italian power metal band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_of_Fire"&gt;Rhapsody of Fire&lt;/a&gt;) use it to such good effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S76CGGPqI3s"&gt;Tchaikovsky's "Scene" from Act II of &lt;i&gt;Swan Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchaikovsky"&gt;Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;1812 Overture&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the first piece of instrumental music that I heard that portrayed it's story perfectly (who can't love music that uses &lt;i&gt;cannons&lt;/i&gt; as a musical instrument), but it's just not quite as beautiful as the &lt;i&gt;Swan Lake's&lt;/i&gt; "Scene".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUmq1cpcglQ"&gt;Prokofiev's &lt;i&gt;Dance of the Knights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard this piece in the form of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DymceY5CowE"&gt;Lords of Bedlam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (by the Austrian symphonic black metal band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollenthon"&gt;Hollenthon&lt;/a&gt;), and eventually went on a hunt for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokofiev"&gt;Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev's&lt;/a&gt; original from his &lt;i&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/i&gt; ballet. It's the sort of tune that gets stuck in your head for years, and never truly leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvm2ZsRv3C8"&gt;Chopin's &lt;i&gt;Fantaisie-Impromptu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limiting myself to listing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopin"&gt;Frédéric François Chopin&lt;/a&gt; only once was difficult, since Chopin's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef-4Bv5Ng0w"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prelude No. 4 in E minor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is by far, the most emotional piece of music I have ever heard, and no single piece of music has quite as much effect on me. However, &lt;i&gt;Fantaisie-Impromptu&lt;/i&gt;, which is heavily inspired by Beethoven's &lt;i&gt;Moonlight Sonata&lt;/i&gt; (another work which maybe should have made this list) is easily one of my favourite pieces of pieces of piano music. Interestingly, it's the most complex piece I've ever tried learning on the piano. Too date, I have mastered the first two notes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKfGDqXEFkE"&gt;Grieg's &lt;i&gt;Piano Concerto in A minor&lt;/i&gt;, Movement I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the only piano concerto &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Grieg"&gt;Edvard Hagerup Grieg&lt;/a&gt; ever wrote is somehow the one of the most famous piano concerto's ever. It's the introduction that I enjoy most, but the rest of the piece is extremely relaxing and perfect background music when reading or working. As &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bailey"&gt;Bill Bailey's&lt;/a&gt; character Manny from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_books"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt; says, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjyaJ-7P9ho&amp;t=9m48s"&gt;"It's good isn't it. It's sort of relaxing."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdiAwCPb_As"&gt;Rachmaninoff's &lt;i&gt;Piano Concerto No. 2&lt;/i&gt;, Movement II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff"&gt;Sergei Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt; hated his second piano concerto. He wrote it while trying to recover from clinical depression and severe writer's block. I have mixed feelings about a lot of Rachmaninoff's work, but this particular piece is one that I always enjoy listening to. For some reason though, the depressing 1975 pop song (which will remain unnamed) that features the main theme from this movement is one song I can't stand listening to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;10. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOA-2hl1Vbc"&gt;Pachelbel's &lt;i&gt;Canon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Pachelbel"&gt;Johann Pachelbel's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Canon&lt;/i&gt; is quite popular at weddings. Having only been to one wedding in my life, I didn't actually know that. I enjoy it because of the complex harmonies that arise out of such a technically simple piece. For those who don't know, a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(music)"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; is a single melody that is played, with one or more instruments picking up the same melody after a delay (much like rounds in singing). In Pachelbel's &lt;i&gt;Canon&lt;/i&gt;, all of the variation and complexity in the music essentially comes from a single melody interacting with two delayed versions of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;11. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmFcu6QAqI"&gt;"Rondo" from Paganini's &lt;i&gt;Violin Concerto No. 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was torn between listing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Paganini"&gt;Niccolò Paganini's&lt;/a&gt; original violin concerto and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Liszt"&gt;Franz Liszt's&lt;/a&gt; piano version, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnfZjqMSy0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;La Campanella&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, I chose Paganini. I'm not sure why. It's probably because of the violin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;12. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FXoyr_FyFw"&gt;Bach's &lt;i&gt;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach"&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt; actually wrote three Toccata and Fugues for the organ - two of which were in D minor. Two of them (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX8IvbKPoR0"&gt;BWV 538 in D minor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URuYYy0-AxI"&gt;BWV 540 in F major&lt;/a&gt;) are quite similar, and I'm not a big fan of either of them. In fact, I dislike almost all of Bach's music. The one exception, of course is the better known of the three Toccata and Fugues, BWV 565, which is one of the most recognisable organ pieces ever written. It is completely different to any of Bach's other works, and indeed contains many features that were either extremely rare or completely unique at the time. There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565#Attribution"&gt;two possible explanations for this&lt;/a&gt;. The first is that it was not written by Bach at all (there is actually no manuscript signed by Bach), and the second is that it was actually written for violin and later transcribed for organ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;13. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5REOSSRalc"&gt;"The Sea and Sinbad's Ship" from Rimsky-Korsakov's &lt;i&gt;Scheherazade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimsky-Korsakov"&gt;Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov&lt;/a&gt; had an incredible talent for telling stories through music, and most of his orchestral works are the sort of thing you can just sit and listen to at any time. &lt;i&gt;Scheherazade&lt;/i&gt; is just one of my favourite examples of that. He was also renowned as an excellent teacher, describing his philosophy as "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8150654967514820227/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8150654967514820227&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8150654967514820227'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8150654967514820227'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/02/favourite-classical-music.html' title='On My 13 Favourite Pieces of Classical Music'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7895932205466618317</id><published>2013-02-26T07:14:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-02-26T07:14:32.367+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Myth of Car Sickness</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7895932205466618317'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7895932205466618317'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7170881931672977716</id><published>2013-02-21T18:40:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-02-22T12:55:36.911+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fiction'/><title type='text'>On John</title><content type='html'>Crouching forward, glaring at the dull grey light emanating from the screen, the man appeared deep in thought. It took a while to realise that he was dead, and probably had been so for a day or so. Even after realising this, and seeing the red of the gunshot wound in the back of the man's head, John gave the body a quick nudge with the tip of his boot before checking for a pulse, just to make sure. Nothing. Of course. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He left the room, returning less than a minute later with a large black bag.  He pulled the chair out from under the table, and tipped the body onto the floor. In the manner of one who has unexpectedly spent a decade or two too long in one job, he dragged the heavy body into the bag and pulled the drawstring tight. A thick, tattered cord was hastily tied through a pair of roughly cut holes in the bag's base, and John dragged it out into the hallway, carelessly knocking furniture on the way out. He passed by the too-long-out-of-order elevator doors, and made his way down the stairs, the body thunking violently down each step. A hobo lay in a pile of his own vomit, drunk at the bottom of the stairs. John carried on walking, dragging the bag over the hobo’s legs as if he weren’t there. The hobo mumbled something unintelligible in his sleep, but John lurched on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was late morning, although little more than wisps of light could pierce the deep mist curtains that hid the rest of the city away. John tossed the body into the back of a run-down truck. He spent a couple of seconds looking back at the building before clambering into the driver’s seat and heading off. He was tired of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was several hours before he approached his destination. Two blocks away from the place he was looking for, he was forced to swerve at an intersection as a couple in a battered sports car hurtled through on a red light, sending John and his truck skidding out of control into the side of a grey brick apartment block. He yelled profanities after them, but they were already long gone. Mumbling under his breath, he pushed the airbag down and climbed out to inspect the damage. It wasn’t too bad – it could probably be repaired – but the truck would not be going anywhere for a couple of days. That was unfortunate. He doubted that he had a couple of days. He took the body bag and a steel shovel out of the back, and grudgingly dragged them the final couple of blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a park on the banks of the river, beautiful trees dropping autumn leaves which drifted under a large stone bridge. He had always loved this park. It was so peaceful here. He found a quiet corner under a tree, and in the orange light of a setting sun, he began to dig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wondered briefly how strange it was that he felt nothing. It was as if he was fulfilling an almost forgotten promise to a friend with whom he’d long since parted company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body buried, he turned back toward the road. A woman stood watching, long, wispy grey hair blowing gently in the breeze. He was not surprised. He had been expecting her to be there. “It is difficult,” she said, a small tear glistening in her otherwise lifeless face. He shook his head. “An obligation owed. Nothing more,” he replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He took her hand, and the pair walked down the street to the nearby pub. It was deserted, save the sullen barman behind the counter. He gave them little more than a glance as they walked in and seated themselves at the bar. The two sat in silence for quite some time before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hours passed by, and the dirty glasses piled up. The pub closed, and the two made their way to the woman’s tiny apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night blurred into early morning, and John awoke on the kitchen floor. The woman was gone, but empty bottles still lay across the table and floor. Feeling bilious, John staggered out into the street, barely registering that the sun was still not up. His stomach finally giving up the battle, he threw up violently over his pants and shoes. He walked through the doors of the building next door, and passed out in the lobby. He lay there for several hours. Few people walked by, but those that did looked down scornfully, before pretending that they hadn’t seen him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grey-haired woman woke him. “Hurry, we need to leave,” she told him. “If we don’t make it in time…” John nodded, understanding. The two climbed into her car and set off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We won’t make it in time,” John told her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We have to,” the woman replied, pushing down on the accelerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They soared out of the city, and up a windy pass. As they left the mountains behind, the clouds opened up, and the mid afternoon sun pummelled down on them. The distant blue of ocean flickered though gaps in the trees as they heedlessly bounced over the cracked asphalt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speeding through the narrow streets of the city, the woman rashly cut corners, leapt over sidewalks, and completely ignored the traffic signals, sending more than one car swerving out of her way. She came to a stop in the middle of the street outside a battered old building. The two leapt out of the car, and made their way up the stairs, cursing the elevator which was not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the chair, John fired up the computer. “Come on, come on,” he mumbled under his breath. The screen lit up, and he began clicking the mouse furiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Will it work?” the grey-haired woman asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m not sure. We need more time,” John replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We don’t have time. Will it work?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I think so.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We need to be certain.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes. It will work.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Thank-you.” She turned made her way to the door. Her hand on the handle, she stopped and turned. “And, John?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John did not remove his eyes from the screen. “Yes?” he asked, exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m sorry,” she said as she fired the gun. She scrambled down the stairs, out the door, across the road, hurried across the river at the bridge, and came to a stop on a small hill looking over a quiet corner of the park. There, she stood and waited patiently as an old man slowly filled a grave for a long-forgotten friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7170881931672977716/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7170881931672977716&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7170881931672977716'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7170881931672977716'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/02/on-john.html' title='On John'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-317951251985139950</id><published>2013-02-13T00:06:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-02-13T00:06:09.907+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='awkward situations'/><title type='text'>On the Seven-Year-Old Who Bought Stuff</title><content type='html'>Sorting out some paperwork in my cupboard, I came across an invoice for a cheap keyring, dated 5 July 2009. Its not that I don't clean out my cupboard very often (I try do it at least every six months), but I kept that particular invoice for a reason. You see, it's only a copy of an invoice, printed a week after the sale, and I wasn't the one who made the purchase, and, actually, I have never even touched the keyring in question.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I printed and kept a copy of the invoice because, over that one little keyring, threats and accusations were made against me, and on two separate occasions, security guards were called. All thanks to a single cheap little keyring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole issue revealed so many flaws in our society and the way people think that I just had to write a post about it. However, it didn't feel right posting it while I was still working at the shop where the incident occurred. After three and a half years of a two-sentence draft post sitting in my post list, and more than two and a half years since I stopped working at the shop, I finally feel that the time has come for me to write the things that I wish I had been quick enough to think of at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell the whole story. It's pretty long, but I think I should include all the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started at about 4PM on a Sunday, where I was working as a casual in a small retail store. I about five hours into a nine hour shift (immediately after a three hour shift at my sound engineering job earlier that morning), and I was pretty tired. It had been a quiet afternoon, and I'd spent most of it doing reading for my final year research project that I didn't really understand. A small boy walked in alone, and spent quite a bit of time looking around. Now this wasn't unusual - the centre is primarily a casino complex (one of the most popular in the country), and an alarming number of parents would leave their kids to wander the centre while they were off gambling, rather than fork out money for the childcare facilities that were provided. Eventually, the child brought a keyring to the counter, and handed over his money. I ring it up, handed him his change and a receipt, and thought nothing more of it. If it hadn't been such a slow day (that was practically the only sale I'd made that afternoon), I wouldn't have remembered it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The babysitting issue was pretty serious problem for us, but I'll get back to that later. We actually at one stage had a large TV in the store, and we used to play DVDs on it to attract customers. We got rid of it, because we'd inevitably land up with a row of kids seated in the middle of the store as parents left them for hours at a time while they went to watch a show or gamble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At around 6:30, the boy came back with a slightly older (maybe ten to twelve years old) girl. She holds out the keyring, and says "You have to take it back. His father will kill him if he finds out." The store had a no returns policy, but if an item was still in the packaging, I often used to do a refund anyway. Unfortunately, the boy had thrown away the receipt and packaging (so we'd never be able to resell it even if I had taken it back), so I apologised, and explained that I couldn't give a refund. The two left disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closing time was officially 8PM, but I noticed pretty soon after I started working there that there that the store's busy periods coincided with the end of each show at the cinema. I could normally make half a dozen or so extra sales for the day if I kept the store open an extra 30 minutes, and that day was no different. I cashed up and closed off the day's accounts, switched everything off, packed up my stuff and left. Just as I turned away after locking the door (this is 45 minutes after the official closing time), a woman approached me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"How could you sell this to my son!" she yelled, waving the keyring in my face. "He's a child of seven!" I noticed the boy now hiding behind her, terrified. Tired, and just wanting to go home, I asked her calmly if she wouldn't mind coming back the next day - someone else worked Monday's, and I was hoping that by passing off the problem, I wouldn't have to deal with it. She did not accept that. I repeated what I had told her children - that without the packaging and receipt, there was nothing I could do. If a child is old enough to carry money and walk around a shopping mall alone, he's old enough to buy stuff. After around fifteen minutes of arguing, I gave up and began to walk away, but she grabbed my arm and violently pulled me back. That was my trigger - no one touches me aggressively. The two years of Taekwondo training that I'd had at the time probably showed a little in the way that I twisted my arm out of the grip, and I murmured "Don't f****** touch me." Now, those who know me personally will be able to confirm that I almost never swear, and that I am almost always calm. In fact, this was the fourth time out of four that I have ever genuinely lost my temper in public. I turned and stormed off. I heard her calling for security, calling "Stop him! That man stole from my son." I walked through the centre, people staring, straight past the security check point at the exit, made sure no one was going to stop me, got in my car, and drove home. I made a very angry Facebook status update, followed half an hour later by an apology, both to my friends and the woman I swore at (who would obviously never read it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following Sunday evening, an angry man with popping eyes and throbbing veins on his forehead came into the store and started yelling at me. With an awful lot of cursing, he was demanding his money back, but it took me a full five minutes to figure out that he was the husband of the woman I'd dealt with the week before. I explained, as I had to his wife and daughter, that I could not do the refund without a packaging and receipt. he demanded that I get the store owner on the phone. I did so, and the store owner (who'd heard the whole story the week before, and supported the way I'd handled it) explained our no refunds policy to him. The man stormed out. Ten minutes later, he stormed back in. This time, he had a security guard with him. "This is the one. He's scamming children out of their money," he told the guard. The guard asked him to explain the whole story. The man started by explaining how I took advantage of his son's naivety and tricked him out of his money. Then he explained how I had not given his son any change or receipt, changing his story as he went along. Eventually, the story went that I did this all the time: I took advantage of children who had money and overcharged them for unmarked keyrings with no packaging from under the counter, and pocketed the cash. Naturally, I interjected to deny the allegations, to which he responded "Shut up. You'd better watch your back when you go home tonight, because I'll follow you and smash your face in." I could see the situation resolving in the security guards face, even as he explained to the man that threats wouldn't help anything. He asked the man to step outside so that he could ask me my side of the story. When the man had gone, I began to explain to the security guard what had happened, but he stopped me. "Its obvious what's happened here. Don't worry. We'll sort it out." He went out, and I didn't see the man again. Just to be on the safe side, I went back to the previous week's sales, found the transaction in question, and printed the copy invoice in case any more accusations came up. A security guard stood across the corridor for the rest of the day, and when I left that evening, I noticed a pair of security guards following me at a comfortable distance as I made my way through the car park. I put the invoice on my paperwork-awaiting-filing pile, and that's where it's been ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's pretty much the end of the story. I still have the father's eyes imprinted in my memory, and would almost certainly recognise him if I ever saw him again. I probably won't, but if I do see him again one day, I will direct him to this post. Unfortunately, it's a big world, and that's unlikely. Instead, all of you will be the ones who read this, and most of you are the ones who this least applies to. Nevertheless, I feel that it all still needs to be said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the babysitting issue. I know childcare facilities can be expensive, and I know that a lot of people do not trust the people who work in them (they're mostly underpaid with very little experience and no qualifications anyway), but both of these points are easily addressed. The cost is easily argued away by pointing out that gambling is an extremely expensive habit in the first place. If a person cannot afford to pay for childcare services because of a gambling habit, one can't help wondering which other of the child's needs that person is neglecting. If this is a problem for you, you should probably seek free, confidential, expert help from the &lt;a href="http://www.responsiblegambling.co.za/"&gt;National Responsible Gambling Programme&lt;/a&gt;. The second point is even simpler: if a person doesn't trust the childcare staff, then what exactly is it that makes you prefer to put your trust in the roughly 9 and a half million annual visitors to the centre? I wish I'd thought to point out these flaws in their parenting at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the age issue. It turns out that the money that the child spent on the keyring had been intended to buy his dinner. One of the principle arguments that the mother had brought up was that it was irresponsible of me to be selling to such a young child. This is a terrible notion. I started receiving pocket money at around the age of five, and by then my parents were already teaching me the basics of saving up to buy bigger things. I was raised from the very beginning to learn to make sure I really wanted something before I bought it, and if I ever ever decided that I didn't want something after buying it, my parents would simply laugh at me and point out that there was a lesson to be learnt. So when I see a seven-year-old, eagerly handing over money, having been staring at an item on the rack for several minutes, I naturally put my seven-year-old self in his shoes, and imagine that they are coming to a final decision regarding hard earned money. It's not my place to remind him (even if I had known) that he needed the money to buy dinner. I think going hungry for a night would be the best way to teach him where his priorities should lie (this is exactly the same way life likes to teach this same lesson to children and adults alike). That aside, surely if it's irresponsible for me to be selling to a seven-year-old, then it's also irresponsible for a fast food joint to be selling to a seven-year-old? Not to mention giving a seven-year-old money, expecting him to buy stuff?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the blame and accusation issue, and this applies to people in general. Why on earth do some people feel the need to pile up accusation after accusation when they're angry? Even when the accusations turn out to be true (which wasn't the case in this situation), they are often irrelevant - merely constituting an argumentum ad hominem, one of the most common logical fallacies. In this case, of course, the accusations were actually relevant to the complaint, but the repeated exaggeration of the accusation, and adding additional false claims if the originals don't seem to have an impact is a deliberate malicious act. It only serves to weaken the case - inconsistencies in a testimonial form the biggest clue that it is false. It is completely irrational, and I don't think I'll ever understand the thought processes that would lead a person to do that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the threat. How on earth is threatening to smash a person's face in - in front of a security guard, no less - ever going to solve the situation. Especially since, from the security guards point of view, the party making the threats has been yelling and swearing excessively the whole time, while the other party just stood there calmly, unable to get a single word in. People do this all the time. They immediately want to revert to violence, when simple thought and calm debate would get both parties much further. Even if they can't reach agreement, there's always a compromise to be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm glad that I've finally gotten around to writing this post. I'm sorry I lost my temper with a customer - something that I still feel guilty about today - and I'm sorry to everyone who saw me lose my temper. And even though she will never read it, I apologise to that woman. Most of all, I apologise for that poor little boy (who will be eleven this year), who has had to grow up with parents like that.

It got me wondering about applying the theory of relativity to everyday situations. For those who are unfamiliar with relativity, let me start by giving a quick explanation.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're sitting on a small boat in a wide lake, aimed into the current, looking down at the water and watching the waves rushing past, its easy to imagine that you're cruising through the waves at speed. By looking at the shore, the illusion is broken, and you can see that you are in fact stationary, or merely drifting along. Now imagine the same scenario, but this time far out at sea, with no shoreline to look at to confirm your speed. It is impossible to tell how fast you are moving, if you are moving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This effect was first described by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"&gt;Galileo Galilei&lt;/a&gt; in 1632, and is called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity"&gt;principle of relativity&lt;/a&gt;, and it basically says that you can't measure your absolute speed - you can only measure your speed relative to something else - and the laws of physics remain the same, regardless of what you choose to measure your speed against. So in a boat, you like to think of the shore as stationary, so you measure your speed relative to the shore, but you could just as easily have chosen another boat, or anything else with a constant speed for that matter. You should have covered this much in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two and a half centuries. People were thinking on a much greater scale. If we're on the surface of a rotating Earth, the Earth is rotating around the sun, the sun is in a spinning galaxy, so everything is in relative motion. It had to stop somewhere. Using the prevailing understanding of physics at the time, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment"&gt;Albert Michelson and Edward Morley&lt;/a&gt; realised that it should be possible to work out the absolute velocity of the Earth in space by measuring the speed of light in different directions. They set up their experiment, and got extremely accurate results. The only problem was that they measured exactly the same speed of light in all directions. Turns out, it doesn't matter how fast you're moving, or in which direction, you will always measure the same value for the speed of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple decades later, and a young Albert Einstein tried putting the two together to see what came out. He started by assuming that there is no preferred reference frame, and that measuring the speed of light will give the same value in all of them. He got some startling results. For that to remain true, space and time would have to distort for a moving body. He derived formulae for the dilation of time and space for a body moving at a constant velocity, and called it the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"&gt;special theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;. Special, because it only looks at the one special case of zero acceleration. Einstein then spent the rest of his life trying to remove that zero acceleration assumption, and eventually came up with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"&gt;general theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;, which could be applied to all moving bodies, and describes how space and time are distorted by gravitational fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the passage of time slows down as you move faster, and speeds up as you move away from a heavy body (such as the Earth). So, if a particular journey causes the passage of time to go slower for a particular person, then they will have aged less than someone who did not go on that journey. To the stationary observer, it may appear that the traveller "gained" a certain amount of time, although to the traveller, time would actually seem to have passed normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maths behind special relativity, as it turns out, is not too complicated - and space and time dilation depend only on the ratio of the object's velocity to the speed of light. The maths behind general relativity is a lot scarier, but for some simple cases (like constant gravitational pull), it reduces to some manageable formulae - the simple sort of plug-in-and-get-your-answer types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, can we apply some of these formulae to everyday situations? Like calculate the time that people who are up and moving are "gaining" over you, sitting in front of your computer? The answer is yes, and so I tried to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets start with something simple, like walking. A typical walking speed is just under one and a half meters per second, where as the speed of light is just under three hundred million meters per second. Lets put that ratio in numbers: 1/200 000 000, or in scientific notation, 1/2x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. The time they'd "gain" over you is given by a simple equation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex={\color{white} \frac{t_{traveller}}{t_{you}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c} \right )^2}}}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?{\color{White} \frac{t_{traveller}}{t_{you}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c} \right )^2}}}" title="{\color{White} \frac{t_{traveller}}{t_{you}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c} \right )^2}}}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;where &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt; is the traveller's speed relative to you, &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; is the speed of light, and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;you&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;traveller&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are the times that you and the traveller experience passing respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All very well, but if you plug the ratio into the formula on your calculator, you get one - i.e. for every minute that passes for the walker, one minute passes for you, but that's not exactly right. Using a higher precision calculator, the actual answer is not far from 1-1.25x10&lt;sup&gt;-17&lt;/sup&gt;. That means that for every minute that passes for you, only 0.9999999999999999875 minutes pass for the walker. In other words, the walker "gains" an extra three quarters of a millionth of a nanosecond for each of your minutes he spends walking. Its not surprising that we don't notice time dilation in every day life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets get a little faster. A car on the freeway travels at around 30m/s, which is a ten millionth of the speed of light. Plugging into the formula, we get about 0.999999999999995 minutes passing for the car for each minute that passes for you, the car "gains" three ten-thousandths of a nanosecond. Not much, but a lot more than walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faster still, in an aircraft. Now things get complicated, because although you're quite happy at your 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of gravitational acceleration in your chair, at the aeroplane's altitude of something around 35 000 ft (depending on flight conditions, of course), gravity is about a third of a percent weaker. This complicates things, because it means we can't just apply special relativity - we need to use general relativity to account for the differences in gravitational fields, and this means differential equations. Fortunately for us, they've been solved before, with a few approximations, so we can just use this simple equation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex={\color{White} \frac{dt_\text{E}}{dt_\text{c}} = \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{2U}{c^2} - \frac{v^2}{c^2} - \left( \frac{c^2}{2U} - 1 \right)^{-1} \frac{{v_\shortparallel}^2}{c^2} }}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?{\color{White} \frac{dt_\text{E}}{dt_\text{c}} = \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{2U}{c^2} - \frac{v^2}{c^2} - \left( \frac{c^2}{2U} - 1 \right)^{-1} \frac{{v_\shortparallel}^2}{c^2} }}" title="{\color{White} \frac{dt_\text{E}}{dt_\text{c}} = \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{2U}{c^2} - \frac{v^2}{c^2} - \left( \frac{c^2}{2U} - 1 \right)^{-1} \frac{{v_\shortparallel}^2}{c^2} }}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it involves a derivative, but in our aircraft example, the entire right hand side is a constant, so finding the solution is as simple as finding the ratio between two constants. In the above equation, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the time that the object under consideration experiences, and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the time that passes for some stationary object too far away from anything else to be affected by any gravitational field. &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; is the Newtonian gravitational potential, which in this case is simply the Earth's mass times gravitational constant, divided by the distance of the object from the earth's centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we assume that the aircraft is travelling at a speed of 250 m/s, we find that although the special relativity equation slows time down on the aircraft, the difference in the gravitational field actually counteracts this effect to a slight degree (although it's still a net "gain" in time). The aircraft effectively "gains" 9 hundredths of a nanosecond for every minute that passes for you. &lt;a href="http://www.npl.co.uk/news/time-flies"&gt;This experiment&lt;/a&gt; measured a 230 ns time shift on a round the world flight, which assuming 44.5 hours of flight time, can be converted to 8.6 hundredths of nanosecond per minute. I love it when my maths corresponds with reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets go faster still. It's not an every day situation for most, but lets consider the International Space Station. At 7700 m/s and an average altitude of 410 km, it's a lot higher and faster than the aircraft. Plugging the numbers into the formula, we get a "gain" of almost 23 nanoseconds for every minute that passes for you. That equates to astronauts on the ISS aging 0.006 seconds less than those of us stuck here on the ground &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Overview"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; puts that value at 0.007 seconds. I'd assume that Wikipedia's value is more accurate than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinating, but it's hard to imagine how the space and time dilation would look and feel. If you missed it last year, MIT Game Lab made a game to demonstrate various relativistic effects as you approach the speed of light.

This is a summary of some of the changes I usually make to a freshly installed OS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noises.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without fail, the very first thing I do is turn off system sounds. They're annoying, and who knows why they're still turned on by default on every system I've ever used?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Space.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Windows, I move the start bar to the side of the screen, because I feel that vertical real estate is far more valuable than horizontal on a wide screen. In GNOME, I disable the bottom panel for the same reason. I then shrink the icons to the smallest size that's practical and still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I install an antivirus in Windows (usually &lt;a href="free.avg.com"&gt;AVG Free&lt;/a&gt;), or make sure that a simple firewall is installed and switched on in Linux (I like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall"&gt;UncomplicatedFirewall&lt;/a&gt;). Along the same lines, I disable the guest login account if it isn't already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Browser.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually install &lt;a href="www.google.com/chrome"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, because the billions of saved passwords I have but can never remember are automatically synced. If &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; comes installed by default (as on a number of Linux distros), I might just enable the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/omnibar/"&gt;Omnibar&lt;/a&gt; extension and put off this step until I need one of those passwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drivers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I install any drivers that came with the computer, and update the graphics drivers with the latest version from the manufacturer's website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dropbox.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever cloud syncing app you use to make backups and store those things you can't do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desktop.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After setting the desktop wallpaper, I'll delete all of the icons (Oh how I wish Windows would let you delete Recycle Bin). I spend very little time looking at the desktop, so icons there are just a messy eyesore (I launch apps from the menu anyway). Its usually at this point in Ubuntu when I install &lt;a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/quantal/gnome-tweak-tool/"&gt;Gnome Tweak Tool&lt;/a&gt;, and turn off "Have file manager handle the desktop".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screensaver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get rid of them. I set the display to turn off after 10 minutes and lock the computer. I never did like screensavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autorun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like screensavers, I've never liked software that runs itself when I insert a disc or plug in a device. I set the computer to do nothing on media insertion. On Windows, you can achieve this by going to Control Panel -&gt; Hardware &amp; Sound -&gt; AutoPlay and setting it all to "Take no action".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Windows, there's not too much room here, but in any Linux distro, you can do almost anything. Firstly, I set the theme to something as dark but clear as possible. In Ubuntu and related distros, I install &lt;a href="http://ubuntu-tweak.com/"&gt;Ubuntu Tweak&lt;/a&gt;. I set the date format to a sensible order (day-month-year), and make sure it shows the day of the week (because I can never remember that). I also always move the close button to the left (because my clumsy clicking often closes when I meant to maximize). Other than that, I will spend several days trying out various settings and tweaking minor details until I am completely happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Software.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot function on Windows without &lt;a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm"&gt;WinRAR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://windirstat.info/"&gt;WinDirStat&lt;/a&gt;, so I install those first. Second is a codec pack that includes &lt;a href="http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Media Player Classic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://codecguide.com/"&gt;K-Lite&lt;/a&gt; is all you really need). In Linux, it means taking a stroll through the package manager (I prefer to use &lt;a href="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/"&gt;Synaptic&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll usually install that first), and adding whatever you need. &lt;a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/ubuntu-restricted-extras/"&gt;Ubuntu Restricted Extras&lt;/a&gt; are essential if you're going to be using the computer to play any media. Whichever OS I'm on, I'll install &lt;a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/"&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; to manage my e-books and &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;the Gimp&lt;/a&gt; to edit images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortcuts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I don't use desktop shortcuts. Although I launch almost all applications from the app search bar that most OSs have these days, I still like to have quick ways to launch a couple of my more frequently used programs. I pin a few programs (namely the browser and media player) the the taskbar or panel, and add a couple shortcuts (text editor and calculator) to the start menu .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I compiled this list mainly as a reminder to myself, I've shared it with you in the hopes that you find it useful.

This fortunately significantly reduces the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-birthday-shift.html"&gt;birthday shift&lt;/a&gt; down to just over 47 minutes earlier than the 14:38 at which the first ever Alphanumeric Sheep Pig post appeared. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; This time, I'm not going to repeat the embarrassing mistake that I made last year, when the shift of 18 hours and 54 minutes (that I had not at the time calculated) meant that my post landed up going out a day late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last year marked a big step for me. Apart from finally being officially enrolled at university for my PhD, I more or less succeeded at my first attempt at lecturing part of a course. Was I lecturing something related to my thesis topic? No. Maybe the stuff I spent 4 years studying to get a Bachelor's degree? The stuff I studied for two years before that before dropping out? Not even that. On the stuff I taught myself in a week one summer holiday 5 years ago and haven't really used since? Um... Yes... That.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about the blog? Yes, the frequency of posts have been getting slower these days (I blame Minecraft - the game that sucked me in almost two years ago, and hasn't let me go since), but my readership is higher than ever. According to Blogger's official count, I've had over 90 000 hits! Google Analytics says there were 31 265 unique visitors in the last year, from 123 different countries (amongst which South Africa has slipped to fourth place). Wait. I think this needs a map...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9-o5T9K8xgQ/UPeklbG2nOI/AAAAAAAAAjk/rJamx55_BtI/s1600/Map%2BJan%2B2013%2BBlack.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="226" width="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9-o5T9K8xgQ/UPeklbG2nOI/AAAAAAAAAjk/rJamx55_BtI/s400/Map%2BJan%2B2013%2BBlack.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, countries are coloured by the percentage of new visits, so South Africa appears slightly darker than the rest since those tend to be the people who know me personally (Thanks all of you loyal people, and the rest of you too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, amusing Google searches have more or less disappeared off the radar. They are far overshadowed by searches for "minecraft bookshelf" (You're looking for &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/enchantment-level-vs-bookshelf-part-iii.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;), "boeing 747 dimensions" (maybe &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/minecraft-boeing-747-part-2.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;?), or "minecraft mining techniques" (obviously &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/09/on-analysis-of-minecraft-mining.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which may be quite old, but it's still valid), although searches for my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/11/on-ring-around-sun.html"&gt;explanation of the halos around the sun&lt;/a&gt; still feature quite prominently. I have to say that I'm disappointed at the poor performance at my first infographic attempt (&lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/06/on-using-moon-to-guess-time.html"&gt;using the moon to tell the time&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will do my best to keep posting for another year, and hopefully after that.

My excuse is simply and unashamedly that I've been reading. Ayn Rand's &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt; is a book I've wanted to read for a number of years, but I've always put it off, because although I know many people who've started reading it, I don't know of a single person who's finished it.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Seven weeks ago, I finally decided to give it a try, expecting it to be incredibly boring. I was pleasantly surprised. Although Rand's writing is admittedly excessively verbose and repetitive, I found the story captivating and the philosophy it promoted incredibly interesting. It is still fairly slow reading (especially John Galt's three hour radio address, which is quoted uninterrupted, word for word, across more than 60 pages), and it took me seven weeks to reach the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toward the end of the novel, I began to realise that I was the wrong person to be reading it. Its political message of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"&gt;Libertarianism&lt;/a&gt; and philosophical message of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)"&gt;Objectivism&lt;/a&gt; were views I already held, to some degree or another. The people who should be reading it are those who are living representations of the book's antagonists: The James Taggarts, Wesley Mouchs, Phillip Reardens, Robert Stadlers, Floyd Ferrises and Mr Thompsons of the world. The people who envy achievement and would rather jealously devalue the success of others than work towards success of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, all of the characters are inflated embodiments of real life values. At first glance, the events come across as exaggerated in importance, and the consequences of actions appear excessively accelerated. One finds themselves asking, could the events described in the book really lead to the collapse of an entire country in just a few years? It's actually quite scary that the economic collapse that Rand predicts would result from certain interfering social and economic policies reads remarkably similar to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe#Economic_difficulties_and_hyperinflation_.281999.E2.80.932008.29"&gt;history of Zimbabwe's economy in the last couple of decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more worrying is watching the same social and economic policies being implemented or called for in my own country. It's impossible not to draw comparisons between the events in the book and our own stifling labour laws, calls for nationalisation of our largest industries, vast incompetence and indifference of people filling jobs for no reason other than that they need money, obvious corruption in government, refusal of anyone in a position of responsibility to accept blame for a job poorly done, and appointments of friends and family members without regard to qualifications or competence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book has made me fear for the future, and although I don't believe that withdrawing my mind will make the slightest difference, it has reinforced my belief that nothing is more important than rational thought. Everyone inherently knows from birth how to think rationally and objectively. It guides the early development of our minds, and influences our first actions and abilities - discovering the concepts of solidity and thereby learning to grasp objects, drawing the association of words with real objects and concepts and thereby learning to speak, developing an intuitive understanding of concepts like gravity and trajectories and thereby learning to stand and walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only through later indoctrination that we learn to suppress our rational thought, because we are taught that we shouldn't point out that reality contradicts another's opinion because they might consider it offensive, and learn that arguing - the most fundamental principle in rationalism - is viewed as a generally negative thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main theme of &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt; - that there is nothing more important than the value of one's own mind - is something that needs to be taught and reinforced throughout the world. Nothing is more powerful than reason, logic and critical thought, and your ability to apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my first thoughts when I began to understand the meaning of the book was that political leaders should read it, but I soon realised that there is little hope that they'd understand it. As Rand describes, they would "blank out" reality in order to preserve their world view for fear of appearing selfish and moral. The process bears remarkable resemblance to George Orwell's concept of &lt;i&gt;doublethink&lt;/i&gt;. Incidentally, it is for this very reason that &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt; is such a long book (it appears in most lists of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels#List_of_longest_novels"&gt;longest novels&lt;/a&gt;). Having previously written three novels attempting to explain her philosophy, resulting in a flood of questions from people who did not understand it, Rand felt it necessary to explain her philosophy in enormous detail, in as many ways as possible in a single book. Still, the novel receives a lot of criticism, often using arguments of forms that are explicitly debunked in the novel. People are incredibly stubborn when it comes to changing their opinions, and it is for that reason that it just won't make a difference if political leaders do read the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only option we can do is promote a rationalist world view, teach our children to value the same, and hope that we can take over and try again from scratch once the looters have taken us back to a pre-industrial society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope that it doesn't come to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4279594220544888872/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4279594220544888872&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4279594220544888872'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4279594220544888872'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2013/01/on-how-wrong-people-are-reading-right-books.html' title='On How the Wrong People Are Reading the Right Books, and Why It Does Not Matter'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7067704527124592515</id><published>2012-11-08T20:59:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2012-11-08T21:13:21.362+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NaNoWriMo'/><title type='text'>On NaNoWriMo: Part V</title><content type='html'>For the third year running, I am taking part in &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;National Novel Writing Month&lt;/a&gt;. The object of NaNoWriMo is to write an entire 50 000 word novel in just 30 days. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Of course, I'm cheating a little this year by attempting to finish the novel I started last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2011, I only managed 22 186 words, but I grew rather attached to my characters in the process. I promised at the time that I would eventually finish the novel, and that's what I'm doing now. I'm keeping the content separate though, so the word counts don't interfere with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a bit of a synopsis. If you like the story to be completely new the first time you read it (like I usually do) then you can skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0 45px 0 45px;"&gt;"In Part I, we met Amser - the girl from so far away, the seasons are wrong - with her little box of powders and fuming chemicals. We also met Llyr, formerly Pedran, formerly Elhaearn, the son of Cledwyn Roch, former self-appointed lord of the city of Pyr, notorious pirate and marauder, insidious conman, and once proud owner of a sizeable private army that could successfully invade and occupy most of the country, should he have wished. We also met the Types, or at least two of them. Amser claimed to have built their bodies, mixed their blood and poured the life into them, but naturally, Llyr finds that difficult to believe. He would have paid it a lot more attention if they weren't on the run from the Company, who wanted Llyr dead, supposedly because a handful of corrupt politicians wanted him out the way, but there seems to be something even more sinister behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Was that all in Part I? Most of it was, at least. Part II carries on from there, and will hopefully start providing answers. Will we learn why Amser left the Village, what happened to Briallen after the siege? Who is directing the Company, and why? Where is Llyr, and why was he so carefully tracking the Types so far from home, even though he was fully aware of the army of more than a thousand men hot on his heels?  And most importantly, who were the Ancients, and why did they disappear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Will Part II answer these questions? I sure hope so."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can follow my progress on the official NaNoWriMo site&lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/alphanumericsheeppig/novels/type-iv-part-ii/stats"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (notice that I'm always behind?). I update my wordcount there religiously as a form of procrastination, so you can rest assured that it's accurate to within about 10 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time you can read the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-nanowrimo-part-iv-type-iv.html"&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/search/label/fiction"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of all (at least, most) of the fiction works I've posted on this blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my daily progress for a revised goal of 27 817 words (the number needed to take the novel past 50000).

Looking at the way I've turned out, it's amazing how I landed up as the culmination of the collective influences of all four of my grandparents. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Naturally, my parents did play a significant role, but a lot of what they passed on to me came from their parents. There is no doubt that I'm extremely grateful that I had the grandparents I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Douglas (1918-1988): My father and aunt often told me the story about how he was once asked "What do you want to do when you finish school?" He smiled, because by then, he already had a Master's degree in analytical chemistry. Although the only memory I have of him is one of sitting on the floor next to him in his armchair, he still played a fairly significant role in my life. Apart from the fact that I look remarkably similar to him when he was my age, the chemistry and electric kits that I grew up messing around with (which played a big role in how I turned out) came from him.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Barbara (1923-1997): We did not have many TV channels when I was younger, and if it weren't for my grandmother carefully recording shows like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles"&gt;TMNT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaucers"&gt;Dinosaucers&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Rider_and_the_Star_Sheriffs"&gt;Saber Rider&lt;/a&gt;, and  most importantly, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Grommit"&gt;Wallace and Grommit&lt;/a&gt;, I would have missed out on the shows that more or less defined my early childhood imagination. I have no idea how she knew what to tape, but she somehow managed to get the right shows every time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ethne (1932-1999): There's no doubt that my the large majority of my tastes came from my grandmother - from food, to art, to furniture, to music. There are so many piano pieces that make me feel nostalgic because I can remember hearing my grandmother playing them, or even because they have something in common with something she used to play. Even though it's not a piece she played, I cannot listen to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef-4Bv5Ng0w"&gt;Chopin's Prelude in E-minor&lt;/a&gt; without thinking of her and crying.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Alan (1928-2012): I remember when he taught me and my brother how coordinates worked (I must have been about 11 or 12 at the time). We sat with graph paper and carefully worked out the coordinates of vertices so that we could get the computer to plot a Tyrannosaurus. At the time, I thought it was a game, not realising that I'd be using the same concepts at university more than a decade later. It never ceased to amaze me how he could remember maths he'd studied at university 60 years earlier, when I could barely remember stuff I learned in the last couple weeks. My fascination with engineering and large machinery definitely comes from him. One morning in 1995, we followed one of the last steam pulled journeys of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Train_(South_Africa)"&gt;Blue Train&lt;/a&gt;. There is still a framed picture from a calender of that very train on my wall. On one occassion, I got to drive a steam engine by myself (under supervision, of course), taking it up to 70km/h, which is an experience no 9-year-old could ever forget.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6340365695095625082/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6340365695095625082&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6340365695095625082'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6340365695095625082'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/on-grandparents.html' title='On Grandparents'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-654935476548292629</id><published>2012-10-18T09:37:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-11-08T07:29:33.308+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Minecraft'/><title type='text'>On the construction of a Boeing 747 in Minecraft - Part II</title><content type='html'>So, I did mention when this blog was still young that I &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-unfinished-work.html"&gt;very rarely finish things&lt;/a&gt;. But I did promise in my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-construction-of-boeing-747-in.html"&gt;introductory post for my Minecraft Boeing 747 project&lt;/a&gt; that I would make the effort to finish it. And now I have. At least, I have finished the exterior.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started building it around the end of March on the &lt;a href="http://esminecraft.co.za/"&gt;EnderSouls Minecraft server&lt;/a&gt;, so it's taken about 6 and a half months to get this far (admittedly with several breaks, at least one of which lasted several months). It's twice the size of the real thing, and mostly to scale, with a little bit of artistic license here and there (mainly around the windows and the writing on the side). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the building and material gathering was done in survival mode, although I did cheat a little by paying other players to gather a lot of the snow for me (the build took a staggering 160 stacks of snow blocks - which means over 40 000 snowballs needed to be harvested).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway here are some screen shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/GZIeI.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/FgQAf.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/K8bi8.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/vOSem.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had a few people asking me how I did it, I guess I'll give a rough breakdown of my approach to the build. I started by getting a few &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.za/search?q=boeing+747+saa&amp;um=1&amp;tbm=isch"&gt;reference photos&lt;/a&gt;, together with what engineers call a "&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.za/search?q=boeing+747-400+3+view&amp;tbm=isch"&gt;3 view&lt;/a&gt;" - which is just a scale drawing of the top, front and side views of the aircraft. You'll also need to know a couple of dimensions of the real aircraft, and the obvious place to get those is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747#Specifications"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to note that no matter how good you think the photos are, you must be careful taking direct measurements off them, because perspective distorts distances. Stick to the drawings for measurements, and use the photos more for minor adjustments to get appearances right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll almost certainly need to resize the 3 view. It's best to get a lower resolution image and enlarge it, because thicker blurry lines make it easier to fit a blocky curve. You need it pretty big, and you're not concerned about how it looks. The exact size you want is a easy to calculate, but you could find it with trial and error approach. Take the length of the aircraft in pixels in the image, and divide by the real length to get a distance of pixels per metre. I find that you need a minimum of 7 pixels per metre to get a decent representation, so find the factor you need to scale your image by to get 7 (or more) pixels per metre, and scale the image. In my case, I went from a roughly 700x400 image to a 2100x1200 image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used &lt;a href="http://gimp.org"&gt;Gimp&lt;/a&gt; to do most of the measuring, but pretty much any photo editing software that can show a grid over your image and allows resizing and repositioning of the grid will do. Set the grid size to the number of pixels in a metre (in my case, 7). You can then use your discretion to judge the edges of curves. Start by building a frame, and then fill it in later. I found it easiest to mark the blocks roughly in bright colours using the pencil tool. Here's the 3 view I used once I was done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/bbreE"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/bbreE.jpg" width="640px" alt="Click for full size image" target="_blank"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wings and horizontal tail proved the most difficult to design. After a couple of attempts at doing it by eye from the photos and 3 view, I gave up. Instead, I wrote a very simple script in &lt;a href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; that calculates the positions of the blocks based on a minimal number of parameters (I've made this &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/software/#mcwingdesign"&gt;Minecraft wing design script&lt;/a&gt; available for download). One of the files output by the script gives a layer-by-layer breakdown of the wing, which is perfect for building in survival mode. You can easily calculate the angles by reading your coordinates in Gimp, and then using trigonometry to get the angles. If you do this, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;atan2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is your friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These techniques will work reasonably well for any build. If you want to try something like this yourself, all you need is time, patience, and an eye for detail. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/654935476548292629/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=654935476548292629&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/654935476548292629'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/654935476548292629'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/minecraft-boeing-747-part-2.html' title='On the construction of a Boeing 747 in Minecraft - Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2897927753147834696</id><published>2012-10-15T16:28:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-10-15T16:41:38.514+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NaNoWriMo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Stupid Outdated Laws in South Africa</title><content type='html'>November is just around the corner, and that means &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm well on track and fully intend on finishing the novel I started for last year's NaNoWriMo, and I've started making plans for self-publishing, distributing, and of course, making some money.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a big fan of the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/"&gt;creative commons&lt;/a&gt; license, so naturally I'll be releasing the completed novel under a CC license and distributing the e-book for free. I don't really care whether the book makes money or not (I just want people to read it), but I have no problem if some people enjoy it and feel like donating a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many bloggers, artists, authors and even musicians do this. Kevin McLeod of &lt;a href="http://incompetech.com/"&gt;Incompetech&lt;/a&gt;, for example, creates music and releases it for free under a CC license. All he asks for in return is that people share his music, tell the world about him, and if they like, they can donate a little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's exactly the model I would love to use. There is however one small complication. I live in South Africa, and for some reason or other South African law apparently makes it illegal for anyone to receive a donation unless they are a registered Nonprofit Organisation, which I am most certainly not. As far as I can tell, South Africa is the only country that has a law like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I understand the purpose of that sort of law, and I can conceive the role in fighting fraud and corruption it might play, I think that it may be time for the South African government to review it. There needs to be a better way that I can make money from my book than forcing people to pay for it if they don't want to. I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not even going to make suggestions about how the law should be changed, but I'm sure that looking at how other countries handle this sort of thing would be the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's disappointing that a small legal complication stands in the way of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement"&gt;free culture movement&lt;/a&gt; in this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2897927753147834696/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2897927753147834696&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2897927753147834696'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2897927753147834696'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/on-stupid-outdated-laws-in-south-africa.html' title='On Stupid Outdated Laws in South Africa'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8410224573995287493</id><published>2012-10-15T15:09:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-10-15T15:09:08.063+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Psychoactive Drugs (Sort Of)</title><content type='html'>When I was 19, I made a concious decision not to drink alcohol. I don't know why I chose to be like that, but I think it had something to do with the fact that my brain is hard enough to control at the best of times, and I don't like losing control of it, even slightly. I feel the same way about all psychoactive drugs, including caffeine. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I even feel that way about painkillers, which I take only when absolutely necessary - which is about once or twice a year, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning about a month ago, I was fairly short on sleep, so I decided to try a cup of coffee to wake up. It worked, and I felt incredibly alert for the next few hours. However, by lunch time, the effect had worn off, and I was rendered useless for the rest of the day. The next day, I didn't get quite enough sleep either, and so I did the same thing. I kept it up for about two weeks, after which I introduced a second cup a day in order to try to keep my brain functioning for longer. In order to avoid developing a dependence on caffeine, I made sure to have at least three consecutive caffeine-free days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've definitely &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; more alert and productive on those days that I've drunk my coffee, but looking back on how much I've achieved on those days, I don't think I've achieved any more than usual. If anything, I've been procrastinating even more than I usually do (and that's saying something), and I've felt particularly existential and irritable over the past month, which tends to be even more counter-productive. Not to mention that I've had a couple of the worst headaches I've had in years over the past month (not counting those from when my titanium bolt was screwed in), and I blame it all on caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'm going to put a stop to this. No more psychoactive drugs for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8410224573995287493/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8410224573995287493&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8410224573995287493'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8410224573995287493'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/on-psychoactive-drugs.html' title='On Psychoactive Drugs (Sort Of)'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6553900381110040935</id><published>2012-09-28T09:03:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-01-13T09:15:53.037+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='programming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='more or less nothing'/><title type='text'>On SylverMyst Technologies</title><content type='html'>It was almost 2 years ago that I added the little footnote at the bottom of my blog: "A &lt;i&gt;Sylvermyst Technologies&lt;/i&gt; production." Around the time I began this blog, I got tired of forms that asked for an organisation (they're rare, but they exist_, so I just created one. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't even remember what the forms were for. I guess I was supposed to put the name of my university, but I really couldn't see why they'd need that. I actually started with the clichéd "[surname] Technologies", but a very quick Google search ended that idea very quickly. I changed it a bit, and "SilverMist Technologies" was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-time readers of my blog will remember that in early 2011, I moved my blog over to it's cutrrent domain - alphasheep.co.za - and learned a very important lesson: All of the best domain names are already taken. I decided to buy one before it was too late. There's nothing worse than someone who buys a domain name and then just sits on it without putting anything up, so I used my limited knowledge of html and threw together and a very simple webpage with a link to this blog, and a nice (in my opinion) logo in &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/09/open-source-and-the-way-people-see-the-world.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I started making plans to release some of my better software (I had to sift through the 50 or so half finished programs I still had for ones that I'd actually managed to finished). Overall, I put together 7 of them which I felt could have some use or entertainment value. The number of finished programs plummeted to zero around the time I my university workload really picked up, and has never recovered. Incidentally, that's around the same time I started this blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go digging in a cupboard for a long lost copy of Delphi 7. Funnily enough, I stopped developing in Delphi four years ago, around the time I formatted the computer and found that the disc had mysteriously disappeared. Unfortunately, I still couldn't find the disc. All I really needed to do was add a license bit into the about box of each programs and re-build them, so I made another plan (*wink wink*). Funnily enough, I couldn't get Delphi working on my Windows 7 partition without doing a bit of fiddling, but it worked perfectly under Wine on my Linux partition. Oh, how times have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, thanks to an ancient backup disc my brother had made, I also found the little artificial life program that I mentioned in a &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-results-of-boredom-and-not-very.html"&gt;post when this blog was only a week old&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal#Issue_with_CRT_unit_on_fast_processors"&gt;major bug&lt;/a&gt; in Turbo Pascal, it doesn't run on anything with a processor faster than 200MHz. On my computer at the time (a 300MHz Celeron), I found that a pretty decent workaround was to make sure the processor was kept busy enough that it seemed slower. The easiest way of doing that was to play some music in the background (which is something I always do while programming anyway). When I tried it on a computer with a couple GHz, that no longer worked so well. I was a little worried that I'd never get it working on my current computer with it's four cores providing eight processing threads, but somehow &lt;a href="http://www.dosbox.com"&gt;DosBox&lt;/a&gt; doesn't suffer from the problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the need to build a new website from scratch motivated me to learn a little PHP, and so I've pieced together a very small, simple website. Go have a look at everything I've done at &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com"&gt;sylvermyst.com&lt;/a&gt;, and check out a couple of the programs I've written at &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/software/"&gt;sylvermyst.com/software&lt;/a&gt;. Let me know what you think, and of any improvements I could make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6553900381110040935/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6553900381110040935&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6553900381110040935'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6553900381110040935'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/09/on-sylvermyst-technologies.html' title='On SylverMyst Technologies'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7274612079208741810</id><published>2012-09-07T08:56:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-01-13T09:15:53.041+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='programming'/><title type='text'>On Open Source and the Way People See the World</title><content type='html'>I'm not going to lie. The thing that got me into open source software was the price.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let's face it - that's a pretty big reason why many people go the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) route. They download the software, and never contribute, and never donate. I have seen more than one programmer get so frustrated with their users' attitudes that they just abandon the  project. Partly, they're right. It's true that too many users like that would be bad for the open source community. But in a lot of ways, they're wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, many programmers don't see the community like that. Many of them see the community as a group of excited and enthusiastic hobbyists who love the idea that you don't need a huge corporate budget to come up with quality software. You just need a small group of people who are willing to contribute consistently, who are passionate about problem solving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been programming as a hobby for about 12 years now, mainly because I've always found it kind of fun. I had the privilege of lecturing a programming course to a class of just under 200 second year university students earlier this year, and it opened my eyes considerably - both to the way I view programming, and to the way most other people view it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned about the students was both pretty disappointing and pretty encouraging, but I'll get to that in a moment. First, I'll share what I learned about the way I view programming. Not surprisingly, I see it more or less the the same way a stamp collector views collecting stamps, or a musician views playing music. It passes the time, and I simply enjoy time passed programming more than I would have enjoyed that time if I had passed it by doing something else. Problem solving comes naturally to me, and overcoming a challenge gives me a unique feeling of accomplishment that you can't get any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in third year student, we had to plot several charts and graphs for our Aircraft Design course. Naturally, being engineering students, most of us were pretty comfortable with a computer, and the majority of the class would plot the graphs in MS Excel, rather than draw them by hand. Our lecturer warned us that one particular graph we needed to be able to plot was incredible difficult to plot on a computer, pointing out that even companies like Lockheed were still plotting them by hand as late as the mid eighties (computers were better at plotting back then than you might think). Naturally, I took it as a challenge. I rearranged all of the equations, looking back at their derivations, and in a single sitting, I wrote a roughly 250 line Matlab script that calculated all of the curves and plotted the graph, complete with labels. The following day, I set about making the script customisable - adding options to turn features on or off. On the third day, I made the whole thing more user friendly - adding separate files for options and parameters, and added plenty of comments explaining how the code worked. Feeling proud of myself, I printed a few charts for half a dozen or so aircraft, and took a selection to show my lecturer. He was impressed, and showed the rest of the class. I was pretty embarrassed about it, and just sat there in the corner, blushing quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much later in the year, a week or two before our massive design projects were due, someone in my class wanted to know if he could buy my program. Before then, I'd never even considered the possibility that I'd ever sell a piece of software. I thought very carefully about it, and that evening, I hid an obscure line in the code that would print my name in the bottom right corner of the chart, and handed him the entire source code. Later that week, someone else asked me about it, and I emailed them the source code as well. I thought nothing more of it. A year later, another class mate approached me. He had my program, and wanted to know if it was OK to use it to plot charts for his final year project. I said yes, as long as he gave me credit. I thought that would be the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been approached every year since. This year, a student who was almost certainly still in high school by the time I had a bachelor's degree asked me if they could get a copy of the program. It made me realise something fairly important about FOSS. People don't program because they want to make a useful piece of software. They program because they enjoy it, and its the pride that stems from that enjoyment that ensures a high standard of work. And that is exactly what is written in the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html"&gt;GNU manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: You probably were not aware that I recently started making plans to release some of the software I've programmed during my life (including the S.E.P chart script (because its just a script, not a program, whatever students want to call it) mentioned in this post). It's not available yet (I need to make some minor changes to the source code before I release it under CPAL or GPL... whichever I decide to use), but you can still see &lt;a href="http://sylvermyst.com/software/"&gt;descriptions for some of them&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the way my students see programming. An encouragingly large number (at least 10% of the class) seemed passionate about programming. One student, in fact, told me I'd inspired him to change career paths from Nuclear Engineering to becoming a programmer. That's probably the most flattering thing I've ever heard, even though I think it's most likely the thrill of solving a difficult problem that got him, and not my lecturing. Whatever it was, hopefully I managed to convince him not to change career paths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attitudes of the rest of the class scared me a little, and I think its partly because that seems to be the way the rest of the world views programming. Its much the same as what &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9LCwI5iErE"&gt;Benjamin Zander says about listening to classical music&lt;/a&gt;. It's something most people would enjoy doing if they just sat down and gave it a chance. But they immediately assume that they won't enjoy it. Most worrying, however, is that many of them get too caught up in trying to &lt;i&gt;actually learn&lt;/i&gt; certain programs. Not just algorithms, mind you. It's actually quite helpful to have a repository of algorithms to draw from, but there are some things which are merely programming exercises that hardly anyone would ever need to know outside of a classroom. Things like a function to invert a matrix (in practice, the smart thing to do would be to download a matrix math library, with only one exception - that is, if the matrix math library is what you are trying to program). It seems that the students dislike problem solving to such an extent that they will take any measures possible to actually avoid it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, a generic problem solving ability is the most important skill anyone can ever have. Life is just a series of problems, and the better you are at solving those problems, the better you will do at life. If solving challenging problems brings you enjoyment, then you are automatically set to enjoy life. It really is that simple. I think I'm going to have to emphasise that to the next class I teach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Another side note: I was going to write a bit about my gradual shift towards using only FOSS, but I got a bit sidetracked. That will have to come in another post.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7274612079208741810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7274612079208741810&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7274612079208741810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7274612079208741810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/09/open-source-and-the-way-people-see-the-world.html' title='On Open Source and the Way People See the World'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7205316164231511087</id><published>2012-08-20T13:58:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-08-20T13:58:42.218+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><title type='text'>On South African (and Possibly Other) Drivers</title><content type='html'>I don't know what it is, but people in general do not know how to drive. An alarming majority of drivers on the road act either impulsively and irrationally, or nervously and hesitantly. Both of these mindsets are incredibly dangerous and, let's face it, stupid. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the vast majority of my driving is around the Gauteng region, I've noticed no real difference in driver attitudes on trips to Durban or Cape Town in the last couple of years. It seems to be at least a national problem. It may even be that globally, attitudes are changing, but I don't have any experience driving in other countries, so I can't comment on that. This post is a pretty long rant, but I really hope you will take the time to read it, since these points apply to almost everyone (even me, in some cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nervous Drivers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nervous or hesitant driving is indeed dangerous in many situations, and these drivers are a big problem on the road. Almost everyone knows how to solve this problem though, and I bet you're muttering some form of the solution to yourself right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Those drivers should just learn to be more confident on the road.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is indeed the solution, in essence. Just like the solution to world hunger is that the starving should eat more food. Apart from making a major logical fallacy by simply posing the solution as a state in which the problem is absent, it subtly passes the blame onto those nervous drivers, completely ignoring the reasons for their nervousness. Lets face it. The reason most of those nervous drivers are so hesitant is because so many other drivers are impulsive and unpredictable. If everyone drove in a consistent and predictable manner, there would be an incredible reduction in the number of nervous drivers on the road. Which brings me to the next problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impulsive Drivers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me define what I mean by impulsive driving. An impulsive driver is a driver who takes an action without having considered the entire state of his current situation. In other words, it is a driver who acts on a decision without considering all of the available information. It's not necessarily a driver who breaks the rules of the road (I'll get to that in a moment), but rather driver who changes into the left lane when they need to turn right at the next intersection, for example. Or a driver who doesn't stop at a yield when there is a car approaching. Or even a driver who keeps the same following distance regardless of weather conditions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think its a case of drivers consciously ignoring facts (that would be stupid). I think its simply a case of drivers not knowing what to look for, and not knowing where to look. Its a classic case of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;. They are incompetent drivers, but will never seek to be better drivers because they are not aware of their incompetence. The one point which many drivers have very little practical understanding of is stopping distances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Stopping Distances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people have no clue when it comes to stopping distances. Braking as hard as possible without locking the brakes, driving at a speed of 60 km/h, a typical stopping distance is 50m or so. At 80 km/h, it's 70m. At 120 km/h, it's 120m. Great. Numbers. Distances. It's hard to know what they mean in real life. Time is something most of us understand a little better, so let's consider stopping times instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have a stop watch nearby. At 60 km/h, it takes around 5 seconds to stop the car (including a reaction time). But really, how long is 5 seconds? Hold your breath, tense up your right foot (as if you're pushing the brake pedal), and start the stop watch. When it hits 5 seconds, you can relax and breathe again. That wasn't bad. Now try 9 seconds (which corresponds to stopping from 120 km/h. You got it? That is about the shortest possible time in which an average car can come to a stop in dry conditions. If you're ever slightly slow on the brakes, if you push slightly softer, or if the wheels skid for even an instant, it's going to take longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now consider a wet road. In wet conditions, a general rule of thumb is that the stopping distance doubles (but reaction time obviously stays the same), so the time increases to about 16 seconds. Try holding your breath and tensing your foot again, waiting for 16 seconds this time. 16 seconds is a pretty long time, when you're actually thinking about it. Now try the same thing again, but this time, imagine yourself on the freeway, just after an afternoon thunderstorm, doing 120km/h, slamming on brakes as a pedestrian steps into the road a couple hundred metres ahead of you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Intelligent Lane Selection.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is so obvious to those who can do it, but seemingly unreachable for those who can't. In general, you should get into the lane that is going to take you where you want to go. It's stupid to move over into the right lane when you're going to be turning left in a hundred metres. If you need to turn left, then you should move into the left lane &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the turn. If the traffic in that lane is slow, then so be it. Drive slowly for a bit. Your priority should be to follow the general flow of traffic. To go against the flow is both futile and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it's not necessary to get into the right hand lane if you're only going to be turning right several kilometres down the road. You should always be considering how you will be getting into the correct lane, but as a general rule of thumb, you only really need to start moving over to that lane when the turn approaches. In urban driving, this means getting into that lane a block or two before the turn, and on freeways, it means starting to move over to that lane when you start passing signs for the off-ramp you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you're not planning on turning off the freeway any time soon, there's a general guideline to which most drivers seem oblivious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep Left, Pass Right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are even signs at regular intervals along the freeway to remind drivers, but the vast majority (at least 80%, by my estimate) stick in the lane they are in if the road ahead is clear. The mentality of South African drivers seems pretty clear, and I can see those slow drivers mumbling under their breathes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;"&lt;i&gt;If you want to drive fast, go around."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This attitude is absolutely correct. If the vehicle behind you wants to go faster than you, they should indeed overtake you. In fact, they should overtake you on the right. And if you want to do a speed that is slower than the speed limit (even if it's for a brief uphill stretch), then you should move over to the left so that there are lanes on the right for faster vehicles to overtake. I acknowledge that many drivers do move over when a vehicle approaches from behind, but these vehicles should move over to the left if it is safe to do so, even when there happen to be no vehicles behind them at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this doesn't mean that the right hand lane is free to fly along at any speed. Which brings me to my next point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed Limits.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, speed limits on a road are set based on empirical data for similar roads. The actual limit is usually chosen from 60, 80, 100 or 120 km/h (it's a small set to make them easy to remember), and is the highest speed that gives an acceptably low accident rate on similar roads. When finding a similar road, typical factors that are considered are the surface type and quality, frequency and severity of bends, density of both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and the number and type of intersections, amongst other things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many arguments that speed limits are incorrect or outdated, and that modern cars have safety features, and all that. But there are a few things these arguments neglect. While accidents can happen at any speed, the severity of accidents goes up with speed. Also, while cars have safety features added all the time, pedestrians do not. Nor do fences, lamp posts, or buildings. Most importantly, nor do driver's brains. A driver in a modern car is no less likely to make a fatal mistake than a driver 50 years ago. In fact, based on the observations outlined in this post, drivers are more likely than ever to do something stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that aside, driving faster than the speed limit is illegal, just like it is illegal to steal, murder or rape. I know many people who drive way above the speed limit. Many of them do it because they know they won't get caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets face it, committing a crime for the thrill because you know you can get away from it is socially disturbing behaviour. To me, it's not to far removed from a person who breaks into a hospital and rapes patients while they're in a coma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who break the speed limit fall into one of two categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who are oblivious to the rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who know the rules, but deliberately ignore them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Both sorts of behaviour worry me, and in most other aspects of life, they would be considered socially unacceptable, and possibly even sociopathic. And this brings me to yet another point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lack of Regard for Rules in General.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop streets mean stop. No one knows how traffic circles work. Going straight from turning lanes, and turning from straight lanes is dangerous (and turning left from the right only lane in front of traffic going straight is just plain stupid). Solid line means no overtaking. Amber light means stop. Red light means don't go. Many traffic lights even need a sign saying "wait for green". How retarded do drivers need to be that they need to be reminded about the most fundamental principle behind traffic lights?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extent to which people ignore rules on the road is absolutely terrifying. Many people will start thinking I'm talking about the minibus taxis here, but I'm not. I'm talking about you. I'm even talking about me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aggression.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see aggression on the road all the time. A lot of the time, it's not even warranted. I'll give you the best example, and the one you're probably familiar with. Imagine yourself driving along, and a taxi is stopped in front of you to drop off passengers. You have to wait behind it. You get frustrated. When you finally manage to pass the taxi, you hoot and wave the driver your middle finger. Why? The taxi is carrying out a necessary function in society. Stopping to let off or pick up passengers is not against the rules of the road. Sure, hoot away if the taxi actually breaks the rules of the road, but don't just hoot because you're impatient and can't wait two seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if someone does hoot at you, consider why they are hooting. Many drivers are sent into an immediate rage at the sound of a hooter, or the sight of a middle finger. If you're on the receiving end of this, consider that you must have done something to trigger the incident. It may be that you did nothing wrong, but the other person made a mistake that they are unaware of. It's possible, but you should also consider the possibility that you made a mistake that you're not aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever happens, don't get angry, because that just limits your ability to think logically and act rationally. Just relax. Go with the flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never Obstruct the General Flow Of Traffic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is far easier to do than it seems. Don't come to a stop when waiting to merge with high speed traffic, such as on a high way on-ramp. The correct way to do it (and the way that virtually prevents traffic jams) is to match speeds with the traffic by the time you need to merge. Similarly, if you are on the freeway, and there are cars entering from the on-ramp, leave enough space between yourself and the car in front for the cars entering to do so without slowing down the rest of the traffic. The same principle applies when the road narrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another one is to not cross the intersection unless you can clear it. People ignoring this rule is the number one cause of urban gridlock worldwide. It's just frustrating, and it shows that the driver blocking the intersection wasn't driving with a full awareness of what was going on in the road around them. Which brings me to my final point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Aware of &lt;i&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt; Around You.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is too vast to cover completely, but I just have a couple of examples which will hopefully demonstrate my point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see how little people pay attention best when approaching a jam up on a two lane road due to an obstruction in one of the lanes. Both lanes get backed up, and since the cars in the clear lane usually are kind enough to each let a single car from the other lane in at the obstruction, you land up with both lanes moving at roughly the same average speeds. Every now and then, you'll get a car that's a bit slow to pull off, or car that doesn't let the car from the other lane in, or lets two or three cars through. These create waves which flow upstream. Often they are damped out, but sometimes they travel all the way up the jam, and make it seem as if vehicles in one of the lanes is moving quicker than vehicles in the other at any one point. You get these waves in both lanes, and they vary in frequency and magnitude. The net result is that to any driver far enough upstream of the jam, one lane will appear to be moving faster than the other. Many drivers will try to stay in the faster of the two lanes, and constantly change lanes to make sure that happens. If they were to look at more than just the cars immediately around them, but look at the entire traffic jam, they'd realise that their efforts are futile. If all cars wait patiently, and each vehicle from the unobstructed lane lets a single vehicle from the obstructed lane through before going, the maximum waiting time for any driver in the jam is minimised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one is when people act based on the actions of the vehicle immediately in front of them, not looking at what's going on ahead of that vehicle. Consider the case of a very slow moving (or stationary) vehicle in the left lane, followed by cars A, B and C, all of which want to pass. The right lane is full of steadily flowing traffic. When a gap in the right lane approaches, C almost inevitably takes it. B takes the next gap, and A has to wait for the gap after that. Occasionally, C will move into the right lane, but then slow down and let A and B in, which is very nice and all, but this obstructs the general flow of traffic in the right lane, going against my previous point. In an ideal world (which is sadly very far away), B and C would leave the gap for A to take, since A has been waiting longest for the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if A is the only car stuck behind the slow moving vehicle, he will usually follow immediately behind it, leaving only enough space to pull out. Ideally, A should leave enough space between himself and the vehicle in front that he can accelerate to match the speed of the traffic in the right lane if a large enough gap comes along. Sadly, I hardly ever see this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I am not the best driver out there. But acknowledging that is one step further than most South African drives have taken, and knowing that fact automatically makes me a better driver than many. Most of the points I've made above have equivalents in other aspects of life. Know your faults. Don't be ashamed when you make mistakes.

This, of course, completely changes the optimum enchanting level-bookshelf relations that I derived for the &lt;a href=""&gt;previous enchanting system&lt;/a&gt;, just like the 1.1 update broke &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-enchantment-level-bookshelf.html"&gt;the one before that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been digging in the source for the 12w26a snapshot in order to find out what the changes are. To my knowledge, the calculations have not changed since the rebalancing introduced in the 12w22a snapshot released at the end of May. Comparing these to the snippets of source code I had saved from 1.1, I have worked out how the new enchanting levels are calculated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, before I get into that, let me once again reiterate why you'd want to understand the enchanting level-bookshelf relation. There are &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Enchantment_Mechanics#Enchantment_Simulator"&gt;simulators&lt;/a&gt; which can calculate the probability of getting a certain enchantment at a certain level (there is an excellent calculator &lt;a href="http://pernsteiner.org/minecraft/enchant_snapshot/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). This means that if you are looking for a specific enchantment or combination of enchantments, there is an optimum level that would maximise you chances of getting the combination of enchantments that you want. Of course, you can keep rolling new levels to find the level you want, but it is quicker to set the number of bookshelves so that the level you want is most likely to show up, especially if you tend to enchant at the same level every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets start by looking at the relevant changes as stated in the &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history/Development_versions#12w22a"&gt;version history&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The maximum enchantment level has been lowered from 50 to 30. As a result enchantment tables now require only 15 bookcases around them to allow maximum level enchantments."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"With a full enchantment table set with bookshelves, at the bottom of the 3 enchantments, it always shows you the highest number possible"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, before we get into source code, let's try some in-game testing. The first point is definitely true. Level 30 is indeed the maximum level, and there is no difference in the distribution of levels with more than 15 bookshelves. Now testing the second point. With no bookshelves, it seems we are offered random levels in the bottom slot between 1 and 8. The first obvious difference is that maximum with no bookshelves has been upped from 5. Also it seems you are not always shown the highest number possible. In fact, with 5 bookshelves, you are offered levels between 10 and 15 in the bottom slot, and although 10 bookshelves usually offers level 20, it occasionally offers as high as level 23 in the bottom slot (as in the screenshot below). With 15 bookshelves, however, you always seem to be offered level 30 in the bottom slot. The second point, it seems, is indeed only true for a "&lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt; enchantment table set".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7uaRgXCnHDc/UBaEFFm_-JI/AAAAAAAAAiU/Ry-fz_eqT3I/s1600/2012-07-30_14.50.40.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="225" width="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7uaRgXCnHDc/UBaEFFm_-JI/AAAAAAAAAiU/Ry-fz_eqT3I/s400/2012-07-30_14.50.40.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;: Screenshot showing enchantment level 23 being offered with 10 bookshelves (which happens about 1.13% of the time)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what's actually happening in the source code? There are actually only 4 small changes in functionality between 1.1 and 12w26a. The relevant snippets of code (edited slightly to make them more readable) are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In version 1.1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (nBookShelves &gt; 30) { nBookShelves = 30; }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; int level = random.nextInt(5) + 1 + (nBookShelves / 2) +&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; random.nextInt(nBookShelves + 1);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (slotNum == 0) { return (level/2) + 1; }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (slotNum == 1) { return (level*2)/3 + 1; }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; else { return level; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- and in snapshotn 12w26a:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (nBookShelves &gt; 15) { nBookShelves = 15; }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; int level = random.nextInt(8) + 1 + (nBookShelves /2) +&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; random.nextInt(nBookShelves + 1);&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (slotNum == 0) { return max(level/3, 1); }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (slotNum == 1) { return (level*2)/3 + 1; }&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; else { return max(level, nBookShelves*2); }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The changes are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of bookshelves is capped at 15, rather than 30.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The random modifier for the level is between 1 and 8, rather than 1 and 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top slot shows one third of the calculated level, rather than one half.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The level offered in the bottom slot now has a lower bound equal to twice the number of bookshelves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly simple matter to use this to validate the upper and lower bounds for the enchantment levels that we find in-game. The table below shows what these upper and lower bounds are for each number of bookshelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin:0 auto;"&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=2  align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shelves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Middle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bottom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4-11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6-12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8-14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10-15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12-17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14-18&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4-14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16-20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1-7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4-15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18-21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5-16&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-23&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5-17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;22-24&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5-18&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;24-26&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5-19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;26-27&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6-20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;28-29&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6-21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the previous system, I plotted the distributions of levels offered in the bottom slot, but the bottom slot is now heavily skewed toward offering a level equal to twice the number of bookshelves. For instance, with 14 bookshelves, you will be offered a level 28 enchantment 99.2% of the time, with a level 29 enchantment only showing up an average of once every 120 tries. This makes odd levelled enchantments exceptionally difficult to obtain (although none is rarer than the level 50 enchantment was in the 1.1. enchanting system). It also makes a distribution graph look pretty stupid. Even so, I plotted it. Don't ask me why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UlGzubfFLPc/UBaQVWvwk-I/AAAAAAAAAis/R-uusOkZklA/s1600/Level%2Bdistributions.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="322" width="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UlGzubfFLPc/UBaQVWvwk-I/AAAAAAAAAis/R-uusOkZklA/s400/Level%2Bdistributions.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2&lt;/b&gt;: Distribution of enchantment levels appearing in the bottom slot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The optimum number of bookshelves to use to obtain a specific enchantment level is easy to calculate and is shown in the table below, together with the probability that that enchantment will be offered at that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin:0 auto;"&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=2  align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Level&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;b&gt;Shelves&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;b&gt;Probability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 71.3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 55.6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  3 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 40.6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 34.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  5 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 34.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  6 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 3 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 50.8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  7 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 3 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 31.6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  8 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 55.0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  9 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 23.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  10 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 70.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  11 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 10 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 18.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  12 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 73.7%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  13 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 12 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 15.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  14 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 7 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 84.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  15 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 14 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 13.3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  16 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 8 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 86.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  17 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 15 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 10.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  18 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 9 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 92.5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  19 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 15 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 5.5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  20 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 10 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 93.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  21 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 10 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 3.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  22 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 11 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 96.9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  23 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 11 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 2.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  24 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 12 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 97.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  25 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 12 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1.9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  26 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 13 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 99.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  27 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 13 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 0.9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  28 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 14 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 99.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  29 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 14 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 0.8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  30 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 15 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 100.0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the rarity of high odd numbered levels, it is probably quicker for players to restrict themselves to the even number that gives the best probability for the combination of enchantments they want, rather than use an odd number with a slightly higher probability.

I keep noticing things that are absolutely amazing, and I wonder to myself whether people who don't know much about the physics can really appreciate the world around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to go into the physics here but I will leave links to Wikipedia's &lt;a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_light"&gt;basic explanation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_light"&gt;more advanced explanation&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first encounter with polarised light was when I was about 8 or 9 years old, and a friend at school showed me that if you turned the filter on the calculator screen over, you could invert the colours of the numbers. I played around with a couple of filters (I wasn't ever afraid of digging broken calculators out of bins - which are more common than you'd think) and discovered that holding them parallel to each other did nothing, but if you turned one of them perpendicular, the intersecting area would darken. I also found that if you used two filters on the calculator display, and the back filter was a little bent or trampled (because you can't be worried about quality when you're digging out of bins), there would be rainbow colours across the screen. I had a nice unique calculator display with a black background and rainbows through the numbers. I was a little disappointed when I got to high school and found that the fancier calculators had no removable filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have collected a number of filters from various cheap digital toys, 3D glasses (about the only thing they're good for, since I have very poor stereoscopic depth perception), and the like. I keep them in a little transparent plastic box from which I once freed a set of playing cards. I liked the way that the plastic box had little rainbow patterns when viewed between two filters. In physics during my first year at university, I finally learned a bit about how residual stresses in plastics cause them to absorb and admit light of different wavelengths in differing amounts (an effect known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichroism"&gt;dichroism&lt;/a&gt;). That was interesting in itself, but I also learned that sellotape is dichroic. By placing sellotape in layers over a transparent surface, you can create complex patterns of shapes and colours that can only be seen when placed between two polarising filters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all very nice, but it did not prepare me for the experience of seeing the entire world through polarised light. Everything is different. Before I had Polariod sunglasses, I did not really appreciate the way that almost all reflected light is polarised to a degree. In fact, unless the sun is behind you and the surface is reflecting straight at you, the glare from it will be at least partially polarised. That applies to &lt;i&gt;almost every surface&lt;/i&gt;. I don't know if I can convey the absolute magnitude of that. &lt;i&gt;Almost every surface&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think I've noticed before how shiny absolutely every surface. Nothing is truly matte, it seems. The interesting part is that normally while wearing polarising sunglasses, the shine off any horizontal surface is greatly reduced (of course, that's the whole point in polarising sunglasses). However, if you tilt your head at 90°, the shine of all vertical surfaces is reduced, and you still get the glare of horizontal surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember exactly when I got these sunglasses, but it was around four or five months ago. I still can't get over it. While driving, I continuously tilt my head and watch how the reflections change on the surface of the dashboard, other cars, paving, windows, lakes, and pretty much everything around me. It's also interesting that the displays in my car for the clock, radio, petrol meter and the like all polarise light at 45°. This means that they are dimmed slightly when I'm wearing my sunglasses, unless I tilt my head to the right. If I tilt my head to the left (which is the likely case when I'm leaning over to change the station or volume), the display turns black, and becomes unreadable. I wonder if there's a specific reason for the polarisation angle being the way it is. Anyway, I assume people who see me driving a long just think I'm swaying my head to music or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While walking through a nursery over the weekend, I was tilting my head from side to side, looking at the reflections off the plant leaves, when my girlfriend bluntly pointed out that I looked like a retard. I know this, but still. It's just so fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3161642202530741520/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3161642202530741520&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3161642202530741520'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3161642202530741520'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/on-seeing-world-in-polarised-light.html' title='On Seeing the World in Polarised Light'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8677239291784118676</id><published>2012-07-10T09:35:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-07-10T09:35:53.776+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='philosophy'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='religion'/><title type='text'>On Everything. It is Just So Damn Amazing.</title><content type='html'>It's hard not to live life in complete and utter amazement. The shear fact that I am alive in such an incredibly improbable world is unbelievably overwhelming. This is the sort of thing that can only be explained with incredibly long sentences, so I suggest that you brace yourself.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Even more improbable is the fact that I happen to be a human, capable not only of thinking these thoughts, glimpsing the tiny clues as to where our universe came from, but sharing them with others who are equally (and in many cases much more) capable of appreciating and expanding them. I could easily have been born a bacteria, running off nothing more than simple chemical impulses, with no concious awareness of my surroundings, no room to make decisions and manipulate my environment to suit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my concious awareness and ability to manipulate my environment may just be due to chemical impulses as well, but is independent chemical impulses separately directing trillions of cells to interact for mutual benefit, driving such a vastly complex mechanism that the illusions of awareness, conciousness and free will inexplicably emerge from the chaotic interaction at a lower level. And when it comes right down to it, all those chemical interactions are just unimaginably small particles floating through emptiness, pushing each other around according to a simple set of quantitative rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we can look at the universe, and realise that things can be counted, and that everything we see follows simple quantitative rules. If you have two apples, and find another apple, then you have three apples. It is unfathomably simple, and never fails. And everything we see can be counted like this. And when we break it down into smaller parts, there are different rules, but they can still be quantified with the same mathematics. We need more advanced tools to deal with the scale of the mathematics, but on a fundamental level, they are all just extensions of the same counting techniques we use to keep track of how many pieces of fruit we have. We can keep going, on and on, and as we get deeper and deeper, our set of rules keeps on going, and all of it can be quantified by logical extensions of this simple system that we came up with to make sure our neighbour wasn't stealing our cattle. And its not like these applying these rules gives just an estimate of our universe. We demand that they work &lt;i&gt;every single time&lt;/i&gt;. If they do, we mark them as just maybe. And if they don't, even if it's just once, we mark them as definitely wrong, but even so, we have rules that can quantify exactly how wrong they are, and those same rules can tell us how much confidence we can have in our "maybes" as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the end, we're left with this massively complex set of simple, elegant, quantifiable rules. But there are so many rules that no one really knows them all, and no one is even capable of understanding a fraction of them, never mind applying them. But in just a few hundred years, the millions of human minds who have considered them have collectively put together a sufficiently powerful rule set that we can now &lt;i&gt;consider&lt;/i&gt; the possibility that our entire universe is just a momentary interaction caused by a chance collision of two multi-dimensional curtains flapping in an an extra-universal emptiness. Not only consider, but actually have at least a superficial understanding of the quantifiable rules that are theoretically capable of explaining and predicting absolutely everything that will possibly happen in our universe, in a quantifiable manner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, while the rules themselves are so ridiculously simple, the shear number of ways in which they can interact makes them so incredibly complex. The overwhelming majority of them are just special cases of interactions between even simpler rules, which themselves arise out of an even simpler set. And at the bottom, there is a tiny set of ridiculously simple, self-containing rules, whose interactions are so complex that the only way of solving them is to watch an entire meta-universe play out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then within that meta-universe, out of who-knows-how-many possible universes, there is this one. And in it, out of who-knows-how-many galactic clusters, we have this one, and in it, this galaxy. And out of the hundreds of billions of stars, we have our sun, and it's eight little major planets, as many as a couple hundred dwarf planets, and several hundred thousand minor planets orbiting around it. And out of all those, our planet happens to exist. And over the last four and a half billion years, has warped and cooled, to a relatively stable, water-covered ball. And the water has been kept at one of an endless number of combinations of temperatures and pressures that allow it to stay liquid, but repeatedly heated and cooled just enough to cause the convection currents required to mix chemicals formed in long dead stars in just the right ways that they could bond together and make crude but functional copies of themselves using the fragments of similar chemicals floating around them. Our simple set of rules allow this, but it is so endlessly unlikely that it possibly took half a billion years of the right conditions for it to happen. We don't know how - we weren't there to see, and know one has yet had the half a billion years spare time it would take to run an experiment to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these crude chemical copy machines gradually began ripping each other up to make more rough copies of themselves, and those that were ineffective at copying were ripped up, unless some series of fortunate mistakes happened to make it beneficial for those chemicals to be copied by those that could copy. Think about how the world would work under just these simple rules. A protective membrane, for example, would make it much harder for a copier to be ripped up, and so mistakes that caused it to copy the membrane along with itself would be a huge advantage. Simple rules, simple copying, with a couple mistakes along the way. But those mistakes lead to the vast complexity from the simple rules. A mistake that prevents a copier from copying will never spread, whereas a mistake that makes a copier more effective at copying will spread rapidly. For example, a mistake that forces a copier to avoid the copiers with membranes and go after the easy free chemicals (which we can arbitrarily call food) will make copying that much easier, and so these copiers will multiply far quicker than the others. But this means that having a membrane will be a huge advantage, saving those with membranes from being eaten, regardless of their own dietary preference. Soon, most copiers will have membranes, which are easier to break in groups, and so mistakes in the copying that lead to the copiers working with those of the same kind will give an advantage. This leads to multicellular organisms, and by the same simple copying rules, with the same sorts of advantageous and disadvantageous mistakes by these little copying machines, you get the trillions of cells that make up my own body, firing off the electrical, chemical and physical impulses that drive my body, and allow me to have thoughts like this. That's evolution. It's completely logical, undeniable on a fundamental level, and absolutely, incredibly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it's random chance, but its a selective chance. It seems improbable for all the random coincidences to line up, but its far more likely than you'd think. I once heard an explanation using an analogy of rolling 20 dice and trying to get 20 sixes at once. If you roll all 20 dice once every second, you'd need to keep rolling them each second for an average of a hundred and fifteen million years before getting 20 sixes by pure random chance. It could quite possibly even take far longer than that. But we're not talking pure random chance with evolution. We're talking about selective chance. Imagine you're rolling 20 dice, but with each roll, you're allowed to keep the best roll that that dice has given you. So you roll the 20 dice, and you'd expect around three or so to land on six. So you keep those sixes, and roll the others. There's a 99.9% chance that you'll have the 20 sixes in under sixty throws, and the chances of not having 20 sixes after 100 throws are about one in two million. Throwing some form of selection into the mix makes a phenomenal difference to those random mistakes - the difference between a hundred million years and a couple of minutes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you see what I just did. I pulled out a tiny set of my limited quantifiable rules, and applied them to a simple scenario, and not only predicted the future, but also quantified how likely my predictions are to be correct. I can test these with experiments, and predict in advance how often I'll be right. The very fact that I can do this blows my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as amazing as that is, and as astounding as the collective understanding of the universe that science has pulled together over the last few hundred years is, there are still some people - far too many people - who think that a single book can explain it all, and that what the book doesn't say is beyond our understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screw it. I want to understand. Reality is far too incredible to sit back and be satisfied and just accept things we don't know. All we have is clues, some subtle, some not, that lead us deeper and deeper into a labyrinth of rules. We don't know if we're on a dead end or not. We're feeling around in the dark, not knowing where we are, where we've been, or where we're going. All we know is that we're here, and dammit, I want to know what's at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I'm trying to say is fuck religion. No one knows the truth. We all need to stop being so gullible, believing in a made-up fairy tales and obvious bullshit. Reality is far too exciting to just ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8677239291784118676/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8677239291784118676&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8677239291784118676'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8677239291784118676'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/on-everything-it-is-just-so-damn.html' title='On Everything.

I read somewhere (I can't remember where) that forcing yourself to remember dreams is a good way to train your short term memory to dig things out of your subconscious. I have no idea whether it's true or not, but it sounded worth a try. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really been able to remember my dreams. If I even recalled having dreamed more than once every two months, it was a lot. To be honest though, I've never really made a concious effort to remember them. So, I have read up on how to train your brain to remember dreams, and it really is as simple as remembering to make the effort every morning before your brain starts writing over those parts of your memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The method for doing that seemed to be recommended the most was using a dream journal. I don't like the idea of having to write out by hand in the early hours of the morning (I'm too much of a perfectionist to deal with the sloppy handwriting and constant self-editing when my brain is basically half asleep), so I bought myself a small battery-powered LED reading light, and installed a simple note taking applet in my Kindle (which is always next to my bed anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been recording my dreams the moment I wake up for one week now, and have recorded twelve dreams in total already (not counting the one that I was too lazy to write down at 3am on Sunday morning). I have remembered dreaming every time I have woken up in the last week, which is possibly more than I recalled from the rest of the last year combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a probably unrelated side note, I have gone from drinking coffee maybe once every two to three months to around three or four times a week, starting from just under two weeks ago. Probably unimportant, but changes in environmental conditions are always worth noting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I think I've identified the reason that I remember so few of my dreams. The reason is most likely that they are completely and utterly mundane. For example, I had a dream that I was sitting in the back seat of a car with my brother next to me, staring out the window as the car drove along the same route I drive every day to work. Or sitting impatiently waiting for an invoice for books that I had ordered. Or sitting quietly in a movie with my girlfriend while watching the credits scrolling up the screen forever, thinking nothing but that having such long credits before the movie starts just puts the audience to sleep. They are so utterly mundane that there is no wonder I have so rarely remembered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was all very disappointing, considering what my subconscious mind throws at me while I'm awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3308154647816398593/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3308154647816398593&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3308154647816398593'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3308154647816398593'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/06/on-dreams-part-ii.html' title='On Dreams: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-120483475275947815</id><published>2012-06-18T08:37:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-06-18T09:28:08.452+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='time'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sky'/><title type='text'>On Using the Moon to Guess the Time</title><content type='html'>I decided to try something different for this post.

Along the Swaziland border, it will be visible for as long as 15 minutes after sunrise. That is, if you can find a high enough spot that the damn horizon isn't in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bring up the transit is that, like with eclipses, all the news sources talk about methods for viewing solar events. Of course, everyone knows that you should never look at the sun directly unless you want to go blind (even looking for a couple of seconds can cause permanent damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternatives that are usually mentioned are the trick involving projecting sunlight from a pinhole onto a piece of paper, or wearing welding goggles or specially rated solar glasses (sunglasses do not provide sufficient protection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternative that is very rarely mentioned is that the camera on your cellphone is ideal for viewing solar events. I used the camera on my cheap cellphone to photograph a &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/11/on-ring-around-sun.html"&gt;halo back in November of 2010&lt;/a&gt;, and you can see how well that worked. You can take decent pictures of eclipses just by pointing your camera at the sun. It is very important to keep your head in the shadow of some object so that you cannot directly see the sun, and hold your arm out into the sun using the screen to see where your camera is pointing. You will need to look at the screen at an angle to achieve this. Don't point the camera at the sun for too long at a time unless you have a solar filter. And, whatever you do, don't look at the sun directly, and don't look through any eyepiece of a camera at the sun. Keep your head in the shade and watch the sun on your screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this trick won't work so well with the transit of Venus, since Venus will be a tiny spot on the sun, and the glare from the sunlight will pretty much obscure it completely for your cellphone camera. You can reduce the glare considerably, however, by taking the photograph through the wind shield of a car (many of which are treated for glare), and holding a pair of sunglasses over the camera lens. The cheaper and simpler the camera, the better, since it's more likely to automatically adjust the light levels in the picture, rather than requiring you to set it. You certainly won't get professional quality photographs like this, but at least you'll see what's going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On an interesting side note: Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman watched the first ever detonation of an atomic bomb from 20 miles away with no more eye protection than the wind shield of a truck, because he insisted that you wouldn't see anything through the special goggles they had been given, and the glass of the truck had been treated to block UV rays. He later boasted that he was probably the only one who actually saw the explosion.

W. Norton &amp; Company, 1985.&lt;/a&gt;] Note that the wind shield of a truck does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; provide sufficient protection for looking directly at the sun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: It's not at all difficult to get professional quality solar photographs from the camera of an average smartphone. All you need is a tripod and a special solar filter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am curious to see is whether or not the shadow of Venus will be visible on the surface of the moon (which is just two days past full, and should be fully visible in the western sky during the transit). For reference, if you are interested, Venus will be at the middle of its transit at 03:30 SAST tomorrow morning, and will be in transit for just under three and a half hours on either side of that mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit - 6 June 2012, 07:56 SAST: My very first thought as I woke up this morning was that I had been an idiot thinking that the shadow would be visible on the moon. It makes me wonder what my subconscious does while I'm asleep. I didn't even know yet that I was awake when I realised it. My eyes were still shut. I literally was sleeping one second, and the next second I was awake thinking "The shadow won't be visible on the moon and I'm an idiot, and by the way, its morning now."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, most of the sunny side of the moon would have had a full view of the transit just as good as we had on Earth (actually, Venus would appear 0.6% smaller), but the fact is that Venus only blocks out a small fraction of the sun (0.095% of the light from the sun, according to my quick calculations). And that light would be blocked for most lit side of the moon. So, the net result is that there would have been a really, really slight (no where near perceptible) dimming of the entire moon after midnight last night, and that would be all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, its always interesting to look at the moon through a pair of binoculars, so that realisation did not stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Most people know how to estimate the time from the position of the sun, but very few can tell the time from the position of the moon. Maybe I should do a post about that some time...)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2451157825455151219/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2451157825455151219&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2451157825455151219'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2451157825455151219'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/06/on-transit-of-venus.html' title='On the Transit of Venus'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4563149195948123812</id><published>2012-05-24T11:28:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-05-24T11:28:21.529+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Towel Day Part III</title><content type='html'>Oh dear. A post that has been regurgitated a second time... And it's the second one in a row quoting Doublas Adams. But that important time of year has come around again, so in memory of the death of the great Douglas Adams on the 11th of May 2001, and in celebration of the premier of the Star Wars episode IV on the 25th of May 1977, I’d like to remind every geek and nerd out there to remember to be proud and carry their towels with them tomorrow. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For does the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; itself not say: &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to- hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you never read the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; and don’t understand the significance of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" towel_day”="" wiki=""&gt;Towel Day&lt;/a&gt; do it for the sake of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" geek_pride_day”="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" wiki=""&gt;Geek Pride Day&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.

I can't say the same for those around me (because, while I consider myself to be a reasonable judge of character most of the time, this is the one field in which, due to its very nature, people tend to be completely irrational. Please don't be irrational if you read this. Think calm thoughts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am an atheist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not mean that I believe that there is no god. It means that I do not believe that any god exists. These are two fundamentally different ideas, and I think the difference between them are a primary source of confusion for many theists and a fair number of agnostics too. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realised that it is important for me to talk about my religious beliefs after stumbling across a certain Wikipedia article (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_of_religion_by_country"&gt;Importance of religion by country&lt;/a&gt;), and in particular, the fact that only 65% of the USA perceives religion to be important as opposed to an alarming 84.5% of South Africans. The poll opened my eyes, and I have suddenly noticed the incredible number of devout religious followers in my life every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atheism tends to be tricky to explain to someone who completely and absolutely believes a certain set of religious teachings. The problem seems to be with understanding how atheism goes beyond the whole idea of belief. While all religions tend to emphasise the concept of faith and belief, even putting it forward as the defining characteristic that will earn the most divine rewards ("&lt;i&gt;He who believes in me has everlasting life&lt;/i&gt;" - John 6:47), atheism simply rejects that belief. It's difficult for a believer to understand that. So let me put forward another one of my religious views to help clarify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am also an agnostic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was less informed on the matter, I was very much against being labelled an atheist. I grew up under the impression that atheism was an arrogant assertion of the non-existence of any deity that had no room for error. While I was (and still am) almost certain that no god in the conventional sense actually exists (partially on the grounds that there simply is no evidence that a god exists, nor any need for one to exist), I have never been able to discount the remote possibility that I could be wrong. I am pretty arrogant, but even I do not have the extreme arrogance to claim that I have all the answers to the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot claim that there is no god. I do not believe that there is no god. I do not believe anything regarding the existence of god. It really is as simple as "I do not believe in god". Gradually, as I came to understand more about atheism, I realised that being able to say that one statement truthfully is all that it takes to be an atheist. Now, I am proud to label myself an atheist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am also a pantheist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or more specifically, a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_pantheism"&gt;naturalistic pantheist&lt;/a&gt; in a sense. Being an atheist does not mean that I do not have a sense of awe and wonder at the natural world. The natural world is amazing, and those that know me will know that I am fascinated by almost everything. I have a very high respect for almost all natural phenomena, and life (not only human life) is one of the things that I hold in very high regard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am also an antitheist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really been open about my views before, but I increasingly feel the urge when I am around religious people to point out how absurd and arrogant their beliefs are. I know that the only reason I have never done so in the past is because I lack the confidence in my ability to put forward a convincing argument to convert them to atheism faster than the argument would alienate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I certainly dislike awkward situations, I've come to the point where I'm starting to feel that it is my moral obligation to stop people from throwing their lives away on a fictional concept, and start living their lives with wonder, realising that they actually don't know anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposition to religion tends to cause people to take offence, but it shouldn't. The words of Douglas Adams (possible one of the biggest influences on all of my writing) from his speech at &lt;a href="http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/"&gt;Digital Biota 2 in September 1998&lt;/a&gt; probably highlights this best: "The invention of the scientific method and science is the most powerful intellectual idea, the most powerful framework for thinking and investigating and understanding and challenging the world around us that there is, and that it rests on the premise that any idea is there to be attacked and if it withstands the attack then it lives to fight another day and if it doesn't withstand the attack then down it goes. Religion doesn't seem to work like that... Yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we have agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, from this moment forth, I am going to strive to attack religion with sensible and rational arguments. My aim is not to alienate people, but to inform them of the absurdity of absolute belief. Even if I cannot turn everyone I know into atheists, just having them accept an open-minded and agnostic viewpoint would be enough. I don't intend to be mean and I certainly don't mean offence, but it is inevitable that some will take things offensive. All I am asking is for everyone to just admit that they just don't know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: Even though I was never confirmed, I used to consider myself a Christian until only a year or two ago. And it wasn't like I was young and impressionable when I first started really calling myself a Christian. I was in my very late teens when I first started seeking religion, and spent almost two years calling myself a Buddhist before I began calling myself Christian. Gradually, I came to realise that I didn't really believe, nor did I need to believe. It is not at all difficult to drop belief in the Bible, and dropping belief in God is only a small step away from that. I suggest that absolutely any doubt in the existence of God is a sign that there is an agnostic hiding somewhere in your subconscious. Embrace it. The world is far more complex and amazing than any book could have you believe. Life is so much better than you think. You are free. You are one of billions in a species that is one of billions on a planet that is one of billions in a galaxy that is one of billions in the universe. And is the universe one of billions in something else? Quite possibly, but that's the awesome thing. No one really knows! Isn't that completely amazing in itself? Not knowing but striving to find out, I can assure you, is far more exciting than pretending that you know but can never understand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a final side note: Religion was one of the absolute no-go topics when I started this blog (I still thought of myself as a Christian back then). I guess that I have changed a lot.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7864436974243535150/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7864436974243535150&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7864436974243535150'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7864436974243535150'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/05/on-religious-beliefs-and-my-own-lack.html' title='On Religious Beliefs, and My Own Lack Thereof'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1743773414696434809</id><published>2012-05-09T11:29:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-05-11T07:56:44.641+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sky'/><title type='text'>On the Sizes of Things in the Sky, Part II</title><content type='html'>On the 6th of May 2012, many people noticed and reported on the so-called "abnormal" size and brightness of the moon. It just goes to show how little people notice if its not pointed out. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I wrote last month about &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-sizes-of-things-in-sky.html"&gt;the sizes of things in the sky&lt;/a&gt;, in which I explained why the moon varies in size, anywhere from 9.3% smaller than to 4.8% larger than the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moon has an elliptical orbit, which means that it can be considerably closer at one point of the orbit than at another point. Over 40 000 km closer, in fact (which is actually less than 6% closer than it's average distance). This point in the moon's orbit is called the perigee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The perigee has an interesting property - the rate at which the moon is getting closer or further from the Earth is slowest at this point. That means that the perigee is a gradual thing, and the moon stays close to this distance for a couple of months at a time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A supermoon is arbitrarily defined to occur when the moon is within 90% of its perigee during a full or new moon. Astrologers refer to the event as a supermoon, and like to believe that it has some special significance on natural disasters and the like. Astronomers, on the other hand, use the term perigee-syzygy, and point out that apart from causing perigean spring tides, there's hardly any evidence suggesting that it has any significance whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case the media frenzy seems to have made the supermoon of earlier this month appear to be an incredibly rare occurrence, I've taken the effort to look up all the dates of supermoons in the 21st century (i.e. I clicked the second link in the Google results for "super moon dates"). The dates, from the very astrologer who coined the term, for the last and next five years are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: Supermoon dates for full moons from 2009 to 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 11 January 2009   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 31 December 2009  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 30 January 2010   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 28 February 2010  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 18 February 2011  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 19 March 2011     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 18 April 2011     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 6 April 2012      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 6 May 2012        &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 4 June 2012       &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 25 May 2013       &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 23 June 2013      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 22 July 2013      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 12 July 2014      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 10 August 2014    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 9 September 2014  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 29 August 2015    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 28 September 2015 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 27 October 2015   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another type of supermoon - the so-called extreme supermoon, which occurs when the moon is closer than its average closest approach. The table below lists the dates on which this occurs for the first half of the 21st century. You cannot help but notice that 2012 is suspiciously absent from the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 2&lt;/b&gt;: "Extreme supermoon" dates for full moons from 2001 to 2050.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="40%" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 12 December 2008 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 30 January 2010 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 16 March 2011 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 14 November 2016 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 2 January 2018 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 25 November 2034 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; 13 January 2036   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the actual event of an "extreme" supermoon is not that different from a normal full moon, as demonstrated in the picture below. Note that the March 2011 supermoon was supposedly the biggest since 1993.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center; padding:0px 20px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supermoon_comparison.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9dbNdjUeqsY/T6o31uC36uI/AAAAAAAAAgU/N2GkQ3_mMvE/s1600/Supermoon_comparison.jpg" width="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "supermoon" of 19 March 2011 (right), compared to a "typical" full moon of 20 December 2010 (left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:70%;"&gt;Image by Marco Langbroek, 2011 under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported&lt;/a&gt; license.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinating.

The majority of South Africans tend to pronounce it the same as the word "maul", which is indeed a homophone, at least to the Americans. Pronounced the English way, "mall" should almost (but not quite) rhyme with "shall". In non-rhotic accents (that is, accents which tend to drop the letter 'r' if it's followed by a consonant), it it even almost rhymes with gnarl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason, as far as I can tell, is that the Australians got the wrong pronunciation from the Americans, and then South Africans gradually copied it from there. Why the Americans can't pronounce half the words in the English language correctly, no one knows (if I were talking aloud now, this would be followed by a loud clearing of the throat and something like "laziness" mumbled under my breath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8726850927214215366/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8726850927214215366&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8726850927214215366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8726850927214215366'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/05/on-interesting-pronunciation-point.html' title='On an Interesting Pronunciation Point'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-847055286836598083</id><published>2012-05-03T09:38:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-05-03T09:44:45.367+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Better Dates for South African Public Holidays</title><content type='html'>Public holidays that fall on a Tuesday or Thursday (like earlier this week) tend to trigger that thought of "Hey, it's one day short of a long weekend, so why don't I just take an extra day off?". This leads to a drop in productivity for that week. Wednesday holidays tend to spark similar reasoning for some people.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;If you exclude the two Easter holidays, the two Christmas holidays and New Year's Day, you are left with seven public holidays. Each of these seven holidays will fall on a different day of the week, so that each day from Monday to Sunday has a corresponding public holiday. This year, it just so happens that these roles are filled by Heritage Day, Workers' Day, Human Rights Day, Women's Day, Freedom Day, Youth Day, and the Day of Reconciliation respectively, but this varies from year to year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory, this even distribution should mean that there will be the same number of those "extra days off" every year (exactly two). Likewise, there will be exactly one public holiday missed each year due to it falling on a Saturday (at least for those of us in Monday to Friday jobs). So, from year to year, the overall number of unproductive days should be identical. However, there is little consistency in the distribution of these. Also, an additional "extra day off" comes in if either Human Rights Day or Freedom Day falls on a Wednesday in the same week as one of the Easter public holidays (as happened in 2011). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to deal with all of this, I propose that those seven public holidays be assigned dates that move from year to year. This is not dissimilar to the way that federal holidays are observed in the United States. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done all of the necessary calculations to minimise the distance that each holiday moves in the years 2000 to 2100, inclusive. The table below gives my proposed public holiday dates, as well as the average deviation from the current date for that holiday throughout the 21st century. Where there was no difference between having the holiday on a Monday or Friday, I favoured a Friday holiday, but a Monday holiday would be equally valid (although I suspect that a week with a Friday holiday would be more productive than a week with a Monday holiday). Holidays for which this was the case are marked with an asterisk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: Proposed New Public Holiday Dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="30%" style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Public Holiday &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Current Date &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Proposed Date &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Deviation &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Human Rights Day      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 21 March     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3rd Monday of March      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3.03 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Freedom Day           &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 27 April     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Last Friday of April    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1.71 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Workers' Day          &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1 May        &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1st Monday of May        &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3.97 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Youth Day             &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 16 June      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3rd Friday* of June      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.29 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Women's Day           &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 9 August     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2nd Friday* of August    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.28 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Heritage Day          &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 24 September &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Last Friday of September &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.97 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Day of Reconciliation &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 16 December  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3rd Monday of December   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.28 days &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, many people do attach some significance to a particular calender date, but I have discussed why this is completely unfounded in &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-birthday-shift.html"&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although having Freedom Day on a Monday produces the same net deviation as a Friday, this introduces a possibility for a clash with Family Day in the distant future (as happened last year, and will happen in 2038). Likewise for holding Human Rights Day on a Friday (which would have caused a clash in 2008, and will cause a clash again in 2160). For all other public holidays, the day may easily be switched from Monday to Friday with no significant effect on the deviation from the current date. In the cases of Workers' Day, Heritage Day and the Day of Reconciliation, the day that came out on top only did so because my sample (of 101 years) happened to cover one or two more of one day than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/847055286836598083/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=847055286836598083&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/847055286836598083'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/847055286836598083'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/05/on-better-dates-for-south-african.html' title='On Better Dates for South African Public Holidays'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2487005086776768330</id><published>2012-04-26T11:50:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-26T11:51:26.211+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tuna'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>On Those Somewhat Serious Tones</title><content type='html'>I've always found that I tend to take on a most seriously formal tone in my mind when proof reading my writing, even when my tone was very relaxed and casual when my mind was dictating to my hands what to write. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I recently bought myself a cheap headset and have started recording my voice, and to my surprise, I found that the relaxed and casual voice that is constantly echoing inside my head comes out as slightly boring and monotonous - essentially the same as my mental proof reading voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always liked the sound of my own voice. Not in the figure-of-speech sense that would imply that I talk a lot (although I can, if you get me started, but that's more because my mind just starts throwing things at me, and my mouth just has to do its best to keep up). It actually came as quite a shock to me to hear my recorded voice (which is very different to hearing your voice over speakers while you are speaking). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mind works incredibly slowly. I like to think it's because it's an incredibly complex machine that has far too many intricate parts, so it takes a while for them to all come together and give me a final thought, but really, that's just another way of saying my mind is easily distracted. Anyway, the net effect of this is that my voice sounds much slower when I speak out loud than when I say it in my head, even though they seem to take the same length of time to say. It may sound contradictory, but if you were in my head, you'd know what I mean (obviously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: I'm eating my mother's chicken curry while writing this - easily one of my favourite dishes of all time. Her secret ingredient is apples, which practically disintegrate into the creamy sauce to sweeten it up and balance the flavours. It's just hot enough to tingle on your lips and leave a comforting glow down the back of your throat for a few minutes after eating it, but not so hot that you break into a sweat. And the uniform yellow colour means that I can eat it in what ever order I like, as long as I pick out the chunks of chicken first.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: I'm not sure why, but my thoughts have been very incoherent recently. I really struggle to pick one thought at a time from the hundreds my subconsciousness throws forward. Incidentally, this started shortly after I started my current box of Omega 3 supplements. They are now yellow capsules (they used to be red), have different ingredients, and come in different packaging. I am starting to doubt that they are even the same thing. If only I was more fond of sea food.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2487005086776768330/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2487005086776768330&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2487005086776768330'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2487005086776768330'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-those-somewhat-serious-tones.html' title='On Those Somewhat Serious Tones'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-549280011302558170</id><published>2012-04-17T10:26:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-17T10:31:39.464+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sky'/><title type='text'>On the Sizes of Things in the Sky</title><content type='html'>This post was undoubtedly and unashamedly inspired by a certain post at &lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/"&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. In a recent comic, Inman wrote "Write a post explaining why the sun and moon appear to be the same size in the sky." And so I did.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that we don't actually see sizes and distances. Each eye picks up a flat, two dimensional projection of the world. Our brain then calculates a couple of angles (or actually retrieves them from a database of interconnected neurons that carefully and automatically arranged themselves to match the outside world during your very early childhood), and you interpret these angles in three dimensions to give distances, instinctively using the distance between your two eyes as a reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on to the sun and the moon. At any time, the distance from you to the sun is somewhere between 147 and 152 million km, and the sun is just under 1.4 million km across. However, our eyes only see this as an angle. Using elementary trig, this means that we see the size of the sun as an angle of between 0.52 and 0.54°.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The distance to the moon varies a lot more. It could be anywhere from 362 to 405 thousand km away from the Earth, but it's only about 3470 km across, so our eyes see the size of the moon as an angle between 0.49 and 0.55°. In other words, it's about the same angle as the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason the angles are similar is that, entirely by coincidence, the ratio of the distance to radius of the sun (at 150 million to 1.4 million) and same ratio for the moon (384 thousand to 3.47 thousand) turn out to be remarkably close together (110 and 108). Because the Earth has an elliptical orbit around the sun and the moon has an elliptical orbit around the Earth, the moon can appear anywhere from 9.3% smaller to 4.8% larger than the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, since the moon is almost 400 times closer to us than the sun, shouldn't our brains be able to tell us that the sun must be 400 times larger than the moon? Most people's brains (not mine though) are pretty good at judging distances. Millions of years ago, when our distant ancestors were apes climbing in trees, they needed to be able to tell where the next branch to grab onto was, or risk falling to their death. So, evolution placed our two eyes on the fronts of our heads a fixed distance apart, and gave our brains the ability to interpret the subtle differences in the angles that our two eyes see as distances. That is how I know (ignoring my common sense) that the car outside my office window (which appears an 8.6° angle to my eyes) is much larger than my computer mouse (which appears as a 10.4° angle), despite the fact that I can cover the car completely with my mouse (which can in turn be covered by my pinky finger next to my eye). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch is that, as the objects get further away, the differences in the angles our eyes perceive also gets smaller at a ridiculous rate. For example, my eyes happen to be roughly 7 cm apart, so the difference in the position of my computer mouse between my two eyes is a whopping 8°, yet for the car outside, it is only a tenth of a degree. That's how my brain knows that the car is almost 100 times further from me than the mouse. Our brains work well with differences of tenths of a degree. They can even deal with hundredths of a degree to a certain extent, but when they get into thousandths of a degree (the sort of angles you get from distant mountains), they start going wobbly. Anyone who's been hiking in an open flat environment can tell you that it's impossible to tell if a hill is two kilometres away or ten. When we look at the moon, the difference in the moon's position over that distance works out to just over a millionth of a degree, and for the sun, it's just a few billionths. Our brains have no hope of perceiving such small angles. (Just for interest, the difference in angles for the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, is less than 5 millionths of a trillionth of a degree.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, the sun and moon are the same size for exactly the same reason that you can pretend to squash other people with your thumb, or take photos of some idiot pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/549280011302558170/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=549280011302558170&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/549280011302558170'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/549280011302558170'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-sizes-of-things-in-sky.html' title='On the Sizes of Things in the Sky'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3940085538307811483</id><published>2012-04-12T15:23:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-17T16:57:07.820+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fashion'/><title type='text'>On Collared Shirts</title><content type='html'>I just do not understand the appeal of collared shirts.

One of the first things I started building was a scale model of a Boeing 747. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; One thing led to another, and after a couple of weeks of working on it, I moved on and dropped the project. &lt;/span&gt; A couple of months ago, I started playing Minecraft on a multiplayer server, and from the start, I wanted to start the project over, doing it properly this time. And so I did. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; With slightly less time to spend on it than I'd like (I hate that I enjoy sleep too much to give it up), it is going to take me a while to finish, but I am determined to finish it this time. So, my next big Minecraft project is a scale model of a South African Airways &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-400"&gt;Boeing 747-400&lt;/a&gt; (as shown below) that is roughly twice the size of the real thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fJKpj3o3QlI/T3wZ3qpeeAI/AAAAAAAAAe8/lIDxrpDLMJU/s1600/115141.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="293" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fJKpj3o3QlI/T3wZ3qpeeAI/AAAAAAAAAe8/lIDxrpDLMJU/s400/115141.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the discrete nature of distance measurement in Minecraft, I have taken some artistic license and added or removed a block or two in order to get it to match the look of the actual aircraft. For example, while the actual aircraft is 70.6 m long, I have made my model 143 blocks long in order to balance the distances between features more easily. Likewise, the fuselage is one block too narrow in order to keep the symmetry of the landing gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried something new here. I got myself a headset a while ago and decided to put it to use. I spent about two days working out how to record video with voice commentary in Linux (Fraps is the easy solution, but it only works in Windows). Eventually, I got it working, and so here is the first video I have recorded. I apologise in advance for the sloppy editing, recording, and encoding. Any suggestions are not only welcomed, but are probably necessary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2NuYI_ilzLE/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2NuYI_ilzLE?version=3&amp;f=user_uploads&amp;c=google-webdrive-0&amp;app=youtube_gdata" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2NuYI_ilzLE?version=3&amp;f=user_uploads&amp;c=google-webdrive-0&amp;app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: In the opening and closing sections of the video, my voice sounds particularly nasal. This is because of the smell emanating from the ceiling from what was apparently the rotting corpse of a dead rat (We never did find the body). The middle portion of the video was re-recorded later due to technical difficulties, and my voice is unusually hoarse due to the air freshener sprayed to mask the stink of the rat. Anyway, the presence of rats in the roof is one of the clearest indicators that autumn is here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7085941073420818518/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7085941073420818518&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7085941073420818518'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7085941073420818518'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-construction-of-boeing-747-in.html' title='On the construction of a Boeing 747 in Minecraft - Part I'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fJKpj3o3QlI/T3wZ3qpeeAI/AAAAAAAAAe8/lIDxrpDLMJU/s72-c/115141.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3625417149493290657</id><published>2012-03-27T16:43:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-27T16:43:36.955+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On How to Fix the World: Part II</title><content type='html'>Last week, I wrote about some of the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-how-to-fix-world.html"&gt;problems with the world&lt;/a&gt; as it is right now. I also claimed that I had a solution, which I still believe I do. It is quite simple, really. We just need to get rid of our concepts of equality, respect for opinions, caring for our own, recognising our own success, religion, and taking ownership of our own ideas. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; In this post, I will explain why we need to get rid of these. In a future post, I will hopefully explain how we can achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: I am a pathological hypocrite. If you think this weakens the following arguments, then please read my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/05/on-hypocrisy.html"&gt;post on hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Equality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equality is a difficult one. People don't like being told that someone else is better than them. In truth, people are far too complex to be summed up and quantified, never mind equated. But, that's not the only reason we need to drop our concept of equality. The concept of equality misleads people. I will never run in the Olympic games, and spending my life trying to get there would be a wasted life. But it goes deeper than that. Each and every one of us has had different life experiences, has accumulated different knowledge, and processes that knowledge in a slightly different way. Some people are impulsive, some prone to errors, some are lazy, and some just don't know as much as others might. It is very important for each of us to realise that we are completely different and completely inferior to the ideal person. We each need to identify our own unique flaws and make sure that they are as little an inconvenience to others as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Respecting Opinions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respecting the opinions of others is a very selfish and hurtful act. I have often heard it said that people have the right to their own opinions, but I couldn't disagree more. Sure, if an a person holds a belief that is well formed and justified by all available evidence, then the person has the right to believe that, but I do not consider that an opinion. That is a conclusion, arrived at by applying logical arguments to the available information, and is usually liable to change if more information becomes available. Letting someone's incorrect opinion go unchallenged could lead them to make poor decisions about how they want to spend their money, or more importantly, their time. We all have a social responsibility to make sure that no one's life is ever wasted for the sake of an uninformed opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Looking after our own.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is our natural instinct to want to look after our own children. Is that really the best thing for the entire human race though? Naturally, we all want the best for our children, but shouldn't we want the best for all children? People send their children to private schools when they don't like the public school systems, but shouldn't they rather be trying to improve the public schools? Most importantly, people naturally leave their inheritance to their own children, but why do the children of rich parents deserve money. There is absolutely no guarantee that they will land up intelligent enough, financially smart enough, or business-minded enough to deserve those riches. In fact, the number of "rags-to-riches" stories out there just goes to show that impoverished people are just as capable of producing geniuses as the wealthy. How many more of those stories would there be if every child was given the same opportunity to let their individuality make it for them rather than circumstances of birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Judging Our Success.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we mean by "making it" is often based on meaningless criteria. In my opinion, you can only tell if a person was successful or not many years after their death. Success has nothing to do with wealth, and everything to do with what your contributions did for later generations (of all life in the universe in general). It's really sad how many wealthy people are considered successful, and consider themselves successful, yet live their lives in misery and stress. Don't ever think of yourself as successful. Leave that for future generations to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Religion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religion is the one people tend to take a lot of offence to, although I really can't see why. Whether the teachings of various religions are right or wrong is not the point here (although they are all almost certainly wrong). The point is that teaching our children to take things on faith, rather than weighing up available evidence and drawing logical conclusions, is extremely damaging and irresponsible. It opens them up to manipulation later on in life. Horrors like suicide bombings are only possible if a person has been brainwashed to accept ideas based on faith alone, rather than compelling logical arguments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ownership of Ideas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final concept that we need to get rid of is the one that's already starting to go. We cannot own ideas. Knowledge is not something that can have any monetary value. Ideas and knowledge are infinitely reproducible, and in infinite supply. Discovery of knowledge and inception of ideas is a completely different matter (since these obviously cost time and resources to obtain), but if you have an idea, then holding it back from the rest of humanity for personal gain is an obviously selfish act. Likewise, laws that prevent ideas from being improved upon are counter-constructive. Someone may be incapable of coming up with their own original idea, but that does not mean that they are incapable of improving on another idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, (tl;dr) the world could easily be fixed if absolutely everyone thought logically, changed their opinions in the face of compelling arguments, and had respect for all life, rather than their own, essentially negligible, well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3625417149493290657/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3625417149493290657&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3625417149493290657'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3625417149493290657'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-how-to-fix-world-part-ii.html' title='On How to Fix the World: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-708948171992499673</id><published>2012-03-20T14:30:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-27T13:59:40.705+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixing the world'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On How to Fix the World: Part I</title><content type='html'>Without a doubt the world is broken. Fortunately, it just happens to be quite simple to fix. All it takes is a few concepts: equality, respect for opinions, caring for our own, recognising our own success, religion, and most importantly, taking ownership of our own ideas. The way we can fix the world is quite simply to take all of these concepts, and throw them away forever.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I will explain exactly what I mean in another post very soon, but there are a lot of details to get out of the way first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be young, inexperienced, prone to mistakes, pathologically hypocritical, and largely ignorant about far too much that's going on out there, but I have lived long enough, and naturally tend to think things through (albeit often in a very superficial manner). The problems with the world are countless, and the majority of them are so complex and subtle that it is impossible to put them into words. However, a few of the more serious of these problems that can be put into words. I have made some attempt at this. This is not the ramblings of a bunch of stupid, university-aged, middle-class children in some sort of "occupy" something movement, who know there are problems but can't put them into words apart from some "one percent" gibberish. This is the ramblings of someone who actually has a solution, and is ready to share it. Anyway, to start things off, here are the some of the biggest problems (that I can put into words) with the world as it is right now. (On a side note, I admit openly that I am guilty to some degree for all of these problems.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. A bunch of idiots have gone and screwed up our economic and financial systems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no. That bunch of idiots does not refer to any government. It doesn't refer to the big corporations either. It is quite simply you idiots. Every single one of us is partially responsible for messing up our economic systems. You convince yourselves that you need something that you really have absolutely no use for. You can try to deny it, but if you have ever bought a car when there is a smaller model in the same range, bought a smart phone or tablet (convincing yourself that you "need" it), or even if you are reading this while using the Windows operating system when there are so many free options out there, then you are guilty of making irrational economic decisions at some point. But, it's not just in finances and economics that we make irrational decisions. This brings me to the next problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Humans do not usually make rational decisions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a rational decision, I mean a decision that is made by weighing up all of the options, carefully considering them, making rough calculations (often using intuition rather than mathematics) based on estimated probabilities, and then selecting the option with the greatest overall benefit. Of course, we all think we do this, but we really don't. If you want a good example, look at decisions that have to be made under pressure. Driving is a good example. When people drive, they have to make all sorts of decisions, and irrational choices come up everywhere. Choices like not stopping at an orange or red traffic light, exceeding the speed limit, poor lane choices, waiting for the last second to overtake, and so on. But it's not just limited to driving. There are plenty of other examples in other aspects of life. Our decisions are almost always biased. Why? One of the reasons is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. We are in it only for ourselves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is straight forward. We are selfish. Even in major cases of charity and generosity, there is often some sort of personal motivation. I certainly don't want to detract from what they do (I firmly believe that it doesn't matter why something is done, as long as it is done), but even those that do give everything they have tend to do so for a selfish reason. A person that devotes their entire life to campaigning for cancer awareness might do so because they lost a loved one to cancer. Someone may say that we must save the rhinos, otherwise their children will never get to see those majestic animals (rather than save the rhinos for the rhinos' sakes). I'm not saying that people shouldn't try to save the rhinos, or that we shouldn't be raising awareness for cancer (although I believe that donating to actual cancer research would be a better cause). I'm just talking about motivations. It's definitely not a bad thing when people do good for selfish reasons, but what stops these people from doing bad? And of course, despite the fact that I used terms like "often", "tend to", "might" and "some may" in my explanation, some people will still try to argue against my point here by presenting counter-examples. Which is the next problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. People generalise arguments.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an argument with my dad recently (and it's an argument that I've had with him before) about marriage. He believes that a marriage is a commitment to sort out problems, and believes strongly that a married couple needs to work as hard as they can to honour that commitment and do their best to stay together. I disagreed, stating that this can lead to a lot of unnecessary misery that could be avoided very easily if the couple were to simply divorce (or not bow down to social pressure to get married in the first place). He immediately argued that not all marriages lead to misery, and could not see why that had no bearing on my argument. Another example is the whole Xbox 360 reliability thing that went on a few years ago. I can't recall the exact statistics, but something like one in three Xboxes eventually crashed, giving the infamous red ring of death (RROD). Scores of people piped up to say that it was all rubbish, because they'd had their Xbox for three years and it was still fine. It's like saying that a coin having a 50% chance of landing on heads is wrong because you flipped a coin once and got tails. Mostly, people have no grasp of basic logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/708948171992499673/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=708948171992499673&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/708948171992499673'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/708948171992499673'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-how-to-fix-world.html' title='On How to Fix the World: Part I'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3561317556176227369</id><published>2012-03-13T10:15:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-13T10:16:39.253+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>On Sesquipedalia</title><content type='html'>A sesquipedalian is a long word. It is said to have been coined (albeit in Latin) towards the end of the first century BCE by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace"&gt;Horace&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;i&gt;Ars Poetica&lt;/i&gt; which apparently means "He throws aside his paint pots and his words that are a foot and a half long". &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The prefix "sesqui-", meaning one and a half, is used elsewhere in the English language - for example, a sesquicentenary is a one hundred and fiftieth anniversary. The morpheme "ped", referring to a foot is much more common. The Latin word made it's way into the English language in the mid 17th century, and came to mean a long word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, the fear of long words is therefore sesquipedaliophobia. However, Josefa Byrne, in her 1976 book &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words&lt;/i&gt; (which is not a recognised reputable dictionary, contrary to popular belief), coined a new word by adding two made up prefixes, obtaining "hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia", claiming it to be the fear of long words. Over time the word has gained an extra letter (perhaps deliberately) becoming "hippopotomonstrosesquip&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;edailophobia", and worked it's way into some of the less reputable online dictionaries, such as &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia"&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia"&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;. It is probably important to note here that Wiktionary is open to user edits, and that the entry at Dictionary.com states at the bottom "Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon, Copyright &amp;copy; 2003-2012 Dictionary.com, LLC", whereas a legitimate word states something along the lines of "Dictionary.com Unabridged, Based on Such-and-Such Dictionary, &amp;copy; So-and-So, 2012". Not surprisingly, the word does not show up anywhere in my Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: It is often said that the longest word in the English language is "smiles", as there is a mile between the first and last letters. Actually, if this logic is to be applied, then a word like "campcraft" would be the longest word, since there is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Megaparsecs_and_gigaparsecs"&gt;mpc&lt;/a&gt; in the middle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: The longest word that is actually in my Oxford English Dictionary is "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", and it is quite easy to work out what it actually means. "pneumo-" refers to the lungs, "microscopic" refers to something that is too small to be seen (with "ultramicroscopic" referring to something even smaller than that), "silico-" has to do with sand, "volcano-" indicates ash, and the "-osis" suffix refers to an infection. So the word simply means a infection caused by very fine particles of sand and ash in the lungs - a condition that is usually referred to by doctors as "silicosis".)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On yet another side note: This may look like yet another filler post, and it just may be. Perhaps that means a big post is on its way? One just may be. Perhaps it is that magical post that would fix all the world's problems? I sure hope so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3561317556176227369/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3561317556176227369&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3561317556176227369'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3561317556176227369'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-sesquipedalia.html' title='On Sesquipedalia'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2853766013473738605</id><published>2012-03-06T09:53:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-06T09:53:30.047+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pencil'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Pens, Pencils and Paper</title><content type='html'>I write almost exclusively in pencil. I heard once from a friend (I cannot remember who it was) that psychologists say that this indicates a lack of confidence. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The ability to erase any errors when using a pencil is definitely part of the reason that I use them, but it is not because I lack confidence in my abilities. I change what I am writing a lot. I rewrite each sentence a couple of times until I get the wording as I want it. I do this because whenever I read a sentence that I have written, I know that I am capable of composing a better sentence. As a result, my pen-written work is always an incredible mess, with more crossed out than not, which makes it rather difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I prefer pencil, however, is because of the way I turn and spin the pen in my hand when I think. When I was still in school, and forced to write in blue pen, my hands and shirts (and occasionally my face – don't ask how) would be covered in inky stripes. Even after using a pen for five minutes to fill out a form, I inevitably have at least a couple of stripes across my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, however, I favour typing over pencil. It's just easier not to have to worry about the corners of the paper folding. How it happens, I don't know, but it just may be caused by the way I move around as I write and think. All I know is that it used to frustrate my grade 7 history teacher beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the note of folding paper, I have finally gotten around my problem of the corners of pages and the spines of books folding over as I read them. It was simply a matter of moving into the future. I now find electronic copies of any book I want to read. I've actually reached the stage where a paper book is just to clumsy and awkward that I can no longer even sit and read one for any extended length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2853766013473738605/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2853766013473738605&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2853766013473738605'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2853766013473738605'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-pens-pencils-and-paper.html' title='On Pens, Pencils and Paper'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4286266868646545510</id><published>2012-02-27T10:48:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-13T10:16:29.011+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On the Rudest Awakening</title><content type='html'>I recently watched a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_rickard_the_beautiful_math_behind_the_ugliest_music.html"&gt;TED talk by Scott Rickard&lt;/a&gt;, who deliberately set out to compose the ugliest piece of music possible.

It's not that I've ever had a bad birthday (in fact, they've all been really great so far). It's just that I find the whole concept desperately stupid. But that is not the subject of this post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Without giving it much thought, people celebrate their birthdays on the same calender date every year, without bothering to account for the fact that leap years are a day longer than other years. This leads to a inconsistency where a person who dies at exactly the same age as another (born in a different year) may actually have lived a day or two longer. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't like this, so I propose (for those who do insist on celebrating birthdays) the Birthday Shift, which allows the calender date of the birthday to move around in order to account for the fluctuation caused by leap years. This is not dissimilar to the moving dates and times of the solstices and equinoxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with the way our calender works, I will briefly explain it. Our calender year is not, as commonly stated, related to the length of time it takes the earth to go around the sun. Our calender year is roughly based on what is called the tropical year, which is the average length of time between any two consecutive solstices or equinoxes. This is on average about 365 days, 5 hours and 49 or so minutes, but it varies in length by a couple of minutes from year to year, depending on which solstice or equinox is measured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use what is known as a Gregorian calender year, which attempts to follow the tropical year by using a 365 day year, except in leap years. Leap years occur every fourth year, but not at the turn of the century unless the year is also a multiple of 400. This gives years with an average length of 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds - less than half a minute off from the mean tropical year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The length of time it takes our planet to complete one orbit starting and ending at it's furthest point from the sun is called an anomalistic year, and is about 25 minutes longer than one Gregorian calender year. The time it takes for the Earth to do one complete orbit relative to a more or less fixed reference frame (such as distant stars) is called a sidereal year, and is 20 minutes longer than one Gregorian calender year.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I'm getting at is that the 365 and 366 day years that we use are just an approximation to a 365.2425 day year that our calenders are designed to follow over long periods of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born in the evening. On the same calender date two years later, my parents celebrated me turning two years old. Although I did indeed turn 730 days old that day, I actually turned 2 years (730.485 days) old the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I propose that a person's birthday be redefined as the calender day on which that person's age passes an integer value. This will at least enable a person to correctly report their age in years on their birthday. It will result in the date shifting a little from year to year, but with the aid of modern computers, it is not at all difficult to calculate. One simply finds the number of leap days between your birth and the year of interest from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black%20{\color{White}%20n%20=%20\sum_{y=y_b}^{y_n}%20l(y)}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} n = \sum_{y=y_b}^{y_n} l(y)}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} n = \sum_{y=y_b}^{y_n} l(y)}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where &lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White}y_b}" style="padding: 3px 0 0 0; vertical-align: text-top;" title="\bg_black {\color{White}y_b}" /&gt; and &lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White}y_n}" style="padding: 3px 0 0 0; vertical-align: text-top;" title="\bg_black {\color{White}y_n}" /&gt; are the year in which you were born and the year before the current year if you were born in January or February, or the year after you were born and the current year if you were born in March or later, and the function &lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White}l(y)}" style="margin: -2px 0 0 0; vertical-align: text-top;" title="\bg_black {\color{White}l(y)}" /&gt; is given by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black%20{\color{White}%20l(y)%20=%20\left\{\begin{matrix}%201&amp;amp;;&amp;amp;%20\left(y\textrm{%20mod%20}4=0%20\textrm{%20and%20}y%20\textrm{%20mod%20}100\neq%200%20\right%20)%20\textrm{%20or%20}%20y%20\textrm{%20mod%20}400=0\\%200&amp;amp;;&amp;amp;%20\textrm{otherwise}%20\end{matrix}\right.}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} l(y) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1&amp;amp;;&amp;amp; \left(y\textrm{ mod }4=0 \textrm{ and }y \textrm{ mod }100\neq 0 \right ) \textrm{ or } y \textrm{ mod }400=0\\ 0&amp;amp;;&amp;amp; \textrm{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} l(y) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1&amp;amp;;&amp;amp; \left(y\textrm{ mod }4=0 \textrm{ and }y \textrm{ mod }100\neq 0 \right ) \textrm{ or } y \textrm{ mod }400=0\\ 0&amp;amp;;&amp;amp; \textrm{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total shift, in hours is then simply given by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black%20{\color{White}%20S%20=%205.82%20\left(y_n-y_b\right)%20-%2024%20n}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} S = 5.82 \left(y_n-y_b\right) - 24 n}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} S = 5.82 \left(y_n-y_b\right) - 24 n}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created a spreadsheet that calculates the deviation of the proposed corrected birthday from the traditional birthday in hours, for any combination of year and birth year between 1600 CE and 2400 CE. The shift runs on a 400 year cycle, and exceeds 24 hours for everyone, although occasionally not in a human life time. If you happened to be born in the 101st year of a cycle (i.e. 1701 or 2101), you would have to live to the age of 367 to see it happen. However, if you were born in the years 1696, 1697, 1698, 1796, 1797, 1798, 1896, 1897 or 1898, the shift would have exceeded 24 hours by your fifth birthday. I'd guess that the earliest any of my readers (i.e. people born between 1960 and 2000) could expect a shift would be at the age of 37 for those born in the year preceding a leap year. These people will also be subjected to a 36 hour shift in the year of their 101st birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should advances in medicine manage to keep people born in the years 1903, 1907, 1911 alive to the age of 185 (which I seriously doubt), they will experience shifts of over 50 hours. Those born in 1903 will have such a shift in 2088, 2092 and 2096.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider a more typical case of a person who happened to be born, for arguments sake, at noon on the 5th of February 1983. The actual day on which they are born makes absolutely no difference, provided it is before the end of February. The graph below shows the gradual shifting of the birthday from year to year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KDDMbZ07vEI/T0SO0xyx35I/AAAAAAAAAeQ/2cAsyKb-Gi0/s1600/The%2Bbirthday%2BShift.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="261" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KDDMbZ07vEI/T0SO0xyx35I/AAAAAAAAAeQ/2cAsyKb-Gi0/s400/The%2Bbirthday%2BShift.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shift is quite significant, and if the person in question were to live to the age of 120, they should celebrate only 22.5% of their birthdays on the 5th, 74.2% on the 4th, and 3.3% on the 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, the graph follows roughly the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Calendar_seasonal_error"&gt;same pattern as the time of the summer solstice&lt;/a&gt; (which is not surprising, since they are driven by the same underlying mechanics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if astrologers actually bother to account for the difference between date from year to year. In fact, astrology should use the sidereal year (since it's the one that's fixed relative to the stars) rather than a Gregorian calender year. The resulting shift is magnified by an average of 46% over the first 80 years of a person's life in the sidereal calender, and it loses its periodicity. The cut off points for a certain zodiac sign would have to move about by a couple of days from year to year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6893237680918473004/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6893237680918473004&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6893237680918473004'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6893237680918473004'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-birthday-shift.html' title='On the Birthday Shift'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KDDMbZ07vEI/T0SO0xyx35I/AAAAAAAAAeQ/2cAsyKb-Gi0/s72-c/The%2Bbirthday%2BShift.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3173860122443613861</id><published>2012-02-13T09:31:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-02-13T09:43:05.634+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Banks - The Absolute Stupidity of it All.</title><content type='html'>Because, the way they are currently run in South Africa, they just don't make sense. I have never understood just what it is that banks are trying to achieve. Well, the taking your money part is obvious, but why do they have to be so confusing and inconsistent about it.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a student account. The nice thing about this account is that, provided I budget carefully and plan each transaction, I can get away with paying absolutely no bank charges. Unfortunately, I am rapidly approaching that magic age where they decide that I must be employed by now, so they shove on a rather heavy "account management fee". Naturally, being the stingy person I am, I immediately looked for cheaper options. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not afraid of research, and (as my regular readers will be aware) I am not afraid of doing &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the calculations in order to see exactly which account is the best. Because I've been carefully budgeting and managing my transactions for the last six years, I know exactly how many transactions I usually have, and I know exactly what my balance will do throughout the next year. Because of my investment account where I keep my savings, I am constrained to a particular bank, but this does not matter. I have looked at all of the major banks in South Africa, and all of them suffer from the same problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These problems are pretty easy to identify. They are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Packaged Solutions" are a really dumb idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inconsistent pricing models only make sense the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; way round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It really is cheaper to put your money under your mattress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The things that screwed up the world's economy? They're still there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;I will explain what I mean by each of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. "Packaged Solutions" are a really dumb idea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing the calculations I immediately identified three accounts that would be ideal for me, and two more that would be ideal if I were prepared to slightly alter my financial habits. Why was there not only one? In fact, the first three accounts were practically identical in everything but name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banks have far too many types of accounts, which would be far better off merged into a single account with options regarding details like overdraft facilities and the like. Banks try this, but you land up with ten accounts that can do the same thing for different prices. These so called "packaged solutions" are not a good idea. Banks really should take a leaf from the book of computer hardware and learn some modular design. It is far easier to have independent modules so that a consultant can piece together to perfectly suit the customer's needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one account, with just one pricing structure, the next problem would automatically go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Inconsistent pricing models only make sense the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; way round.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideal account for my needs would be a current account with a cheque card. A current account is pretty cheap, actually. In fact, there are accounts which can have absolutely no bank charges if you keep a minimum balance for the entire month. That sort of account is perfect for me, and so I automatically homed in on those accounts. The catch is that they all require a minimum monthly income from full time employment. Being a full time student, I naturally am not employed full time. While I do get plenty of money from a grant, and do part-time work at the university which comes to far, far more than the bank's required minimum income, the bank will only open the account if I am employed full time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, they insist that I open one of their so-called "savings" accounts. These accounts are incredibly expensive (at least when compared to the current account), but they do not require full time employment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pricing between the current accounts and various savings accounts are quite inconsistent, often for no apparent reason than that it was different people drawing up each account. While inconsistent pricing models are quite common, they usually work the other way round. Take cars, for example. The options on a more expensive cars cost more, naturally. Adding a sun roof or extra cup holders in an expensive car tends to cost more than adding them in a cheaper, less exclusive model of car. Tax is another example of where inconsistent charges work well. You get the rich to pay more, and give the poor a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banks do it back to front, at least for the accounts in the low to mid income ranges. The current account targeting those who are fully employed are cheaper (free, if you're smart) than those savings accounts that are targeted at very low income earners and the unemployed. Charge the poor so that you can give the (slightly) richer a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole pricing issue brings me to the next problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. It really is cheaper to put your money under your mattress.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is true, despite what your bank will tell you. Of course, it is far, far safer to keep your money in the bank. Sure, your money can earn interest if you keep it in a savings account, but the charges are far more. Lets compare the current account I discussed earlier (where keeping a minimum balance will allow you to bank for free) with a typical savings account. The typical savings account will earn interest of a fraction of a percent. If you have that minimum balance in a current account (and provided that your monthly income approximately equals your monthly expenditure), your balance stays roughly constant. If you have the same balance on a savings account, then the interest you earn will be typically a tenth of your monthly bank charges. That's right. A tenth. And after just a couple of years, you will have lost a tenth of your money. In fact, if you account for inflation, your money will only be worth 80% of what you originally invested (compared to about 90% if you had just put the money under your mattress).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of inflation that's the next problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. The things that screwed up the world's economy? They're still there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one would disagree that the primary reasons for the global economic crash of three or so years ago was caused by people spending money they don't have. These are hard times. The economy is struggling. Growth is struggling, inflation is up, and what is the country's solution? Well, in order to encourage economic recovery, they want to encourage spending. How do they do that? They make it cheaper to borrow money. What was it that caused the whole crash again? Oh yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn't make sense, when the average life expectancy is shooting up faster than ever before, to discourage saving. The interest rates keep dropping, and saving prospects keep going down. I know this isn't the bank's fault (it's entirely the fault of government), but it is still a problem that affects the banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I've made my point, and hopefully it's clear enough. It's just unfortunate that all of my ideas would be very expensive to implement. It would be nice if someone high up in one of the banks read this and decided to implement some major changes to the way bank accounts work, but I really don't see that happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3173860122443613861/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3173860122443613861&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3173860122443613861'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3173860122443613861'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-banks-absolute-stupidity-of-it-all.html' title='On Banks - The Absolute Stupidity of it All.'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7934924352381460382</id><published>2012-02-06T16:55:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-02-06T16:55:23.864+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='awkward situations'/><title type='text'>On the Magic of the Unknown</title><content type='html'>It amazes me how so many people still think that technology is magic. Yes, there are robots that (sort of) walk and (sort of) talk like humans. Yes, you can talk to another person on the other side of the world in almost real-time, travel across the world in a day. Not only have people been in space, we have already filled it up with several thousand devices and systems (little more than chunks of metal, really) that we use in our daily life. It is incredible what we have achieved. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of all of this when my family was discussing something (I forgot what) at dinner one evening, and my father innocently said "Well, you can just do an internet and find out?" Although my first thoughts admittedly involved TomSka's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYNdUM2gRsg"&gt;asdfmovie4&lt;/a&gt;, I suddenly realised that my father actually has no idea how the internet works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arthur C. Clarke famously said "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I don't like this saying, mainly because I've seen so many people just accept it. That's just a way of admitting defeat, and saying "I'm never going to understand that". I am incapable of dropping everything like that. I have to understand everything, even if it is only on some superficial level. It is a compulsive urge. It is what drives me to live. I cannot just accept that I don't know something. Everyone is capable of understanding everything. I firmly believe that this is true. It just takes someone to have the first spark, work out one tiny fraction of reality, and write it all down. After some time, their ideas will spread (ever faster now that we have so much sufficiently advanced technology), and more and more people will begin to understand that tiny bit of reality. Viable alternatives for understanding in each field will arise and the ideas will naturally evolve until one is sufficiently complete and has enough support (from reality itself, not in terms of a fan-base), letting the others fall back to be archived. It is a slow process, no doubt, but it is the only one that can possibly work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often look at my dog, who gives the TV barely more than a passing glance, and I wonder what he thinks. He knows that it's not real. I can tell that he understands that they are just projected images. They don't even smell real. He obviously doesn't understand the physics behind it all (or at least, he chooses not to show it), and quite frankly, neither do I. But I do have a vague idea of how the light reflects off of actors and onto a set of photosensitive capacitors, which will hold a minute electric charge if the right amount of light strikes them just right. I understand the basics of how these can be transmitted and stored in various series of copper conductors and silicon semiconductors, and how a series of pre-programmed pulses from a computer system can systematically call each of these charges in order and pass them through an inductor which emits pulses of electromagnetic radiation out into the air several billion times a second, which are in turn picked up by a giant dish floating in space that is drifting at just the right angle to catch them, perform some elementary calculations and then pulse them back down to Earth, where they are reflected through a small coil of copper wire by a small dish on my roof, which emits small electric signals which, after some processing, are passed through tiny cells of liquid, which momentarily crystallise in the presence of an electric field. The light in the room then reflects off the crystals, making it appear as if there is an image on the screen. Complicated, but not magic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that my dog understands this. I just wish that humans would get over it. The world is even more wonderful when you start to see how things work. And when you harness that understanding, and combine it with your knowledge to create something new, nothing can ever beat that combined feeling of wonder and achievement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7934924352381460382/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7934924352381460382&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7934924352381460382'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7934924352381460382'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/02/on-magic-of-unknown.html' title='On the Magic of the Unknown'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4679312981982820790</id><published>2012-01-31T17:36:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2012-01-31T17:36:43.048+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On The Number One Problem With the Human Race</title><content type='html'>I am an idiot.

The number one problem with the human race is that most people do not do this.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager, I was convinced that I knew exactly how to drive a car. I understood all of the basic principles of how the car worked, and had some knowledge of the intricacies of handling a vehicle in various favourable and unfavourable driving conditions (most of which had been gained from playing video games and watching TV). I had built working steering systems and gearboxes from &lt;a href="http://technic.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx"&gt;Lego Technic&lt;/a&gt; sets, and was pretty confident that driving a real car would be simply a matter of adjusting to the size and feel of the controls. Needless to say, when the 17 year old me climbed behind the wheel the day after passing his learner's license, the resulting 3 second journey was enough to scare my poor mother to such an extent that she has never again been a passenger in a car with either me or my brother as the driver, in spite of the fact that we have seven and five years of driving experience respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In psychology, this is known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;. This effect causes people who are completely unskilled in a field to rate their ability in that field as much higher than average. And, unfortunately for us, it affects the majority of the human population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there does seem to be a cure of sorts for the Dunning-Kruger effect. And, it is not that difficult to do. All that needs to be done is to provide some form of basic training in that field. Interestingly, a person is able to rank their ability more accurately after minimal training, even if the actual increase in their ability is negligible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait for the day (if it ever arrives) when everyone receives very limited instruction in every field, just so that they can realise that all of us are incredibly stupid. Once we realise that, maybe we will be able to move on and just take it into account in our decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kruger, Justin; David Dunning (1999); &lt;i&gt;Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments&lt;/i&gt;; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology vol. 77, No. 6; p. 1121.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ehrlinger, Joyce; Johnson, Kerri; Banner, Matthew; Dunning, David; Kruger, Justin (2008); &lt;i&gt;Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent&lt;/i&gt;; Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes Vol. 105 No. 1; p. 98.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See also:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://spikedmath.com/314.html"&gt;Spiked Math #314: The Dunning-Kruger Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority"&gt;Illusory superiority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/793/"&gt;xkcd #793: Physicists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: While I may come across as believing that I rate myself as an above average amateur psychologist in the above post, I'd like to point that I only get my knowledge through reading (something that any educated child can do), and that I do not consider myself an amateur psychologist at all.

You can play it in your browser &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I strongly recommend downloading the client from &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Another Editors Note: This post is outdated. An updated version is available for the enchanting systems introduced &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/enchantment-level-vs-bookshelf-part-iii.html"&gt;version 1.3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It took only three weeks for my post about the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-enchantment-level-bookshelf.html"&gt;Enchantment Level - Bookshelf dependency in Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; to go out of date. One of the most welcomed changes listed in the &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history#1.1"&gt;version history for Minecraft 1.1&lt;/a&gt; reads "Decreased randomness of enchantment levels at Enchantment Tables." I have admittedly been waiting for someone else to go digging in the source code and update the formulae on the &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Enchanting"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;, but no one has. So, I had to do it myself. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I downloaded the &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecraft_Coder_Pack"&gt;Minecraft Coder Pack&lt;/a&gt; and decompiled the source code for versions 1.0 and 1.1. Despite having practically no java experience, it did not take me more than a few minutes to find what had changed. In fact, the only difference was a single line, which had previously read &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; j = 1 + random.nextInt((j &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) + 1) + random.nextInt(j + 1);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and which now reads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; j = 1 + (j &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) + random.nextInt(j + 1);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is immediately obvious that saying that they "decreased the randomness" means they literally went into the code and deleted one call to the function "random.nextInt". At this stage of the code, &lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; is the number of book shelves around the enchantment table, and is capped at 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means is that the enchantment level is calculated by adding together 1, half the number of bookshelves (rounded down), and a random integer between 0 and the number of bookshelves. Later on in the code, a random integer between 0 and 4 is added to this. Previously, instead of using half the number of bookshelves, a second random integer between zero and half the number of bookshelves had been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This obviously skews the distribution of the offered enchantment levels toward the higher levels, but it also makes lower level enchantments impossible to obtain if you have too many bookshelves. This is not an issue, however, because adding and removing bookshelves is not at all difficult. The net result is that instead of requiring an average of 2480 attempts to be offered a level 50 enchantment as before, the user need only make an average of 155 attempts. This should take less than a couple of minutes to find for most players. The updated probability distributions are shown in Figure 1, with the original distributions shown as dotted lines. The sloping distribution in the upper and lower five levels of the range are caused by the additional random integer between 0 and 4 that is added on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tmx3_4FN3vg/Tx_nPQ9xedI/AAAAAAAAAcc/lxKOjTYTqrc/s1600/Probability%2Bof%2Boffered%2Blevel%2Bsmall%2B1.1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="288" width="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tmx3_4FN3vg/Tx_nPQ9xedI/AAAAAAAAAcc/lxKOjTYTqrc/s400/Probability%2Bof%2Boffered%2Blevel%2Bsmall%2B1.1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;: Distribution of enchantment levels appearing in the bottom slot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more important relationship for the player is the one that tells the player the optimum number of bookshelves to use to obtain an enchantment of some desired level. The fact that higher levels are more likely has an interesting effect. Previously, the probability of obtaining lower levels was high enough that the bottom slot was almost always the most likely to offer the level you wanted, even if that level was much lower than the maximum available. After the update, however, the top and middle slots play a significant role, resulting in the optimum number of bookshelves having local minima at levels 26 and 34. The optimum number of bookshelves required is shown in Figure 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sYhP2_mKOns/Tx_nX64SP8I/AAAAAAAAAco/1lBtrMJPEmo/s1600/Optimum%2BBookshelves.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="341" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sYhP2_mKOns/Tx_nX64SP8I/AAAAAAAAAco/1lBtrMJPEmo/s400/Optimum%2BBookshelves.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2&lt;/b&gt;: Optimum number of bookshelves to obtain a desired enchantment level&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks go to FifthWhammy for pointing out a small error.

I still get many strange searches that lead to my blog, such as "pig on a blue screen" or "why is there a dead pakistani on my couch", but I suppose there is no helping some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last year marked my first viral post, the post on &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/09/on-analysis-of-minecraft-mining.html"&gt;Minecraft mining efficiencies&lt;/a&gt;, which attracted over 11 000 visitors within 24 hours of being posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My readership is more international than ever, reaching 92 different countries (or 40 before the viral post). The top ten countries contributing to my readership were the US, UK, Canada, South Africa, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, each of which contributed well over a hundred unique visits. At this rate, I'm spreading across the world even faster than those penguins, which for some obscure reason just turned around and marched (swam) straight back to Antarctica as soon as the seasons changed.

In fact, if you read the label, it would likely list the ingredients as something like "orange juice concentrate, apple, pear and/or grape juice, sodium benzoate."&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; If you are particularly lucky, the apple, pear and/or grape juice may be "deflavoured", whatever that may mean. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is only worrying to you that your orange juice is being mixed with other fruit juices, then I am obliged to remind you that the use of the "and/or" implies that even the label manufacturers are often not sure what juice the orange concentrate is being mixed with. If you are one of the nitpickers who points out that adding sodium benzoate means that it is no longer 100% fruit juice. The concentration of sodium benzoate has to be less than 0.1% by law, meaning that the juice is indeed 99.9 something percent fruit juice. There is no crime in rounding up, especially by such a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is more concerning are sweets. I came across a couple of packets of sweets recently that proclaimed "Made from real fruit juice" prominently on the front of the packaging. Out of curiosity, I picked up a packet of the strawberry flavoured sweets and examined the ingredients, which did indeed state that it contained "apple juice concentrate (4%)". Out of curiosity, I picked up a packet of orange flavoured sweets, which stated the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a slightly related note, it is incredibly likely that my laptop's casing was made from real dinosaurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4768906017829343259/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4768906017829343259&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4768906017829343259'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4768906017829343259'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/01/on-made-from-real-fruit-juice.html' title='On &quot;Made from Real Fruit Juice&quot;'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-699232906350699254</id><published>2012-01-09T16:58:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-01-09T17:03:06.576+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Pigeons and Doves</title><content type='html'>Several times in my life, I have gotten into arguments about the identity of birds. The bird family of Columbidae can be very confusing, because, in truth, no one really knows the difference between pigeons and doves. Even ornithologists can't really decide what the difference between the two are.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="float:right; text-align:center; padding:0px 20px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_dove"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Stigmatopelia_senegalensis_-Gaborone_Game_Reserve%2C_Botswana-8.jpg/800px-Stigmatopelia_senegalensis_-Gaborone_Game_Reserve%2C_Botswana-8.jpg" width="260px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laughing Dove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:70%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69759896@N00"&gt;Sandeep Thoppil&lt;/a&gt;, 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Turtle_Dove"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Ring-necked_Dove_Streptopelia_capicola.jpg/800px-Ring-necked_Dove_Streptopelia_capicola.jpg" width="260px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cape Turtle Dove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:70%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Muhammad_Mahdi_Karim"&gt;Muhammad Mahdi Karim&lt;/a&gt;, 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_Pigeon"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Wohlgen%C3%A4hrte_Stadttauben.jpg/800px-Wohlgen%C3%A4hrte_Stadttauben.jpg" width="260px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feral Pigeon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:70%;"&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Muhammad_Mahdi_Karim"&gt;Alexander Gamauf&lt;/a&gt;, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Originally, the Germanic word that gave rise to the word "dove" refered to all birds in the family Columbidae, whilst the word "pigeon" was derived from the French word that specifically referred to the meat of these birds. After some time, when new species were found and named, the word "pigeon" began to slip in. Now, the birds that are referred to as pigeons and doves are so mixed up, that many species of pigeon are more closely related to doves than they are to other pigeons, and vice versa. In general, however, the words "pigeon" and "dove" are applied consistently within a genus, the only exceptions being the Rock Dove, Stock Dove and Lemon Dove - all of which belong to the genus Columba, which consists of thirty species of pigeon, and only three species of dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reliable way of telling whether a bird is a pigeon or a dove is to identify it and refer to its common name. Fortunately, in South Africa, it is very easy to tell the difference between the most common species of pigeons and doves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Laughing Dove is the most common species to be found in South African gardens. It is easily identified by it's plain colouring, the only decorative markings being faint speckles on the front of it's neck. The similar looking Cape Turtle Dove can be distinguished by the thick black stripe on the rear of its neck. There is very little variation in colouring with these species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feral Pigeon is slightly larger, and has a more pronounced cere than the doves. Pigeons are most commonly found wherever someone may drop food. Feral Pigeons evolved from escaped Domestic Pigeons and have come to inhabit most of the world. Originally, Domestic Pigeons were bred from Rock Doves, which are only called doves because the name "Rock Pigeon" officially belongs to members of the Australian genus Petrophassa. They vary greatly in colour, from plain black to plain white, but are usually grey with a couple of dark stripes across the wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the white doves that are often released at weddings are usually domestic pigeons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in future, just remember that the simplest way to tell the difference is: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those stupid, plain-looking birds that won't get out of the way of your car are doves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those evil red-eyed demons that swarm you in packs at the slightest sign of food are pigeons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/699232906350699254/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=699232906350699254&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/699232906350699254'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/699232906350699254'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/01/on-pigeons-and-doves.html' title='On Pigeons and Doves'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-186727318306278545</id><published>2012-01-03T14:29:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2012-01-03T14:29:16.977+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On the Quartering of Sandwiches</title><content type='html'>Of course, how you cut your sandwiches is entirely a matter of personal preference, but what happens if you have no preference? The majority of shop bought sandwiches are halved into two triangles of roughly equal size, but I find that quartered sandwiches are ever so slightly more convenient to eat with my hands. Exactly the same applies to slices of toast.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was much younger, I liked to have my toast cut into five long fingers. This had the advantage that 60% of the slices would contain almost no crust, but with the obvious disadvantage that the remaining slices would consist almost entirely of crust. In addition, this requires four separate cuts to be made. Cutting the slice into four resulted in half the pieces having an unacceptable large proportion of the crust. By the time I was ten years old, I had abandoned this and adopted the two cut quartering method for good - both for toast and sandwiches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two cut quartering method is illustrated in the diagram below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MB9qNHmbZRs/TwLqTm97y_I/AAAAAAAAAb0/GGLgD2uN74M/s400/diagram.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the sandwich are given by the quadrilateral ABCD. The sandwich is first halved along the line FH, where F and H are arbitrary points along the top and bottom of the sandwich respectively. These two pieces are then halved again simultaneously by making a single straight cut along the line GJ, with G and J representing arbitrary points along the right and left edges respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question that arises from this is where exactly should the points F, G, H and J be located. Obviously, locating them on the midpoints of the line segments AB, BC, CD and DA results in pieces of identical size, shape, and crust distribution. However, as I established from the four versus five fingered arrangement, I would much prefer the majority of pieces to have a below average portion of the crust. Locating the points F, G, H and J exactly on A, B, C and D results in four isosceles triangles of two different sizes - a shape that is very popular for cocktail platters. If we consider a sandwich that is a perfect rectangle of aspect ratio of 1.2, then the two larger pieces will have 16.2% more area than the other two pieces, and contain 20% more crust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="float:right; padding 10px;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="120" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lQsSrUf_L7Y/TwLxpggUR9I/AAAAAAAAAcA/I5ZrgvmzLyI/s400/diagramquarter.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I have even considered locating F, G, H and J on the quarter points, producing the shapes shown to the right. This results in two of the pieces having 9.0% more area and 9.5% more crust than the other two pieces. Unfortunately, there is no possible way using the two cut quartering method method as described here that results in the larger slices having less crust, which would be my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, whatever the maths says, I always find myself reverting back to the standard four little triangles. I wish I knew why I preferred that shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/186727318306278545/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=186727318306278545&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/186727318306278545'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/186727318306278545'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/01/on-quartering-of-sandwiches.html' title='On the Quartering of Sandwiches'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MB9qNHmbZRs/TwLqTm97y_I/AAAAAAAAAb0/GGLgD2uN74M/s72-c/diagram.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1714376694893899071</id><published>2011-12-20T15:07:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-03-01T11:13:39.314+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video game mechanics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Minecraft'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On the Enchantment Level - Bookshelf Dependency in Minecraft</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;[Editors Note: For those who do not play Minecraft, you should.

For example, if you start at level 0, and gain 10 levels and spend them on a level 10 enchantment, and then gain another 10 levels and spend them on another level 10 enchantment, you will have had to kill roughly 154 hostile mobs to obtain those two level 10 enchantments. But, if you gained 20 levels, and then spent all of them on two level 10 enchantments, you would have had to kill around 294 mobs for the same net result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of this, it is necessary to find an enchantment that will use up all (or almost all) of your levels in order to minimise the amount of experience wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When enchanting an item, the player is offered three possible enchantments of random levels. The levels of the enchantments that are offered depend on two non-random and three random variables. The non-random variables are the slot in which the enchantment is offered and the number of bookshelves surrounding the enchantment table, and the random variables are integers uniformly distributed between zero and the number of bookshelves, zero and half the number of bookshelves (rounded up), and one and five. The three random variables are added together, and multiplied by a factor of 0.5, 0.66 or 1.0, depending on whether the enchantment is being offered in the top, middle or bottom slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that with 30 bookshelves around the enchantment table, the maximum level that can be offered in each slot is 25, 33 and 50 respectively. In other words, an enchantment of level 34 or above can only appear in the bottom slot. However, it is possible for a level 1 enchantment to be offered in any of the three slots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, the distribution of the enchantment levels offered is skewed significantly toward the lower levels, with the first, second, third, and fourth groups of 10 levels appearing on average 8.0, 18.2, 9.3, and 3.4 times more often than the fifth group of 10 levels for 30 bookshelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting probability distributions for the bottom slot are shown in Figure 1 below. For clarity, the numbers of bookshelves for which the graph is plotted match the combinations available using Etho's piston mechanism for the variable bookshelf enchanting room (built in episode &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcVABZIQCLA"&gt;episode 112&lt;/a&gt; of his series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDU1S5zyYOQ/TvBKhsu5e2I/AAAAAAAAAbc/ea8a8p55SI8/s1600/Probability%2Bof%2Boffered%2Blevel%2Bsmall%2B2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDU1S5zyYOQ/TvBKhsu5e2I/AAAAAAAAAbc/ea8a8p55SI8/s400/Probability%2Bof%2Boffered%2Blevel%2Bsmall%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;: Distribution of enchantment levels appearing in the bottom slot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The likelihood of being offered a level 50 enchantment is 0.04%, which means that the expected value for the number of attempts required to obtain this is 2 480. At two attempts per second, this means that it would take on average, over 20 minutes of clicking to get a level 50 enchantment. However, with some considerable luck (and faster clicking) this time could be much shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the enchantment levels offered in the middle and top slots favour the same distribution, albeit squashed on the horizontal axis, it is apparent that lower level enchantments are much more likely to show up. For example, with 30 book shelves, a level 17 enchantment is the easiest to obtain. Obtaining an enchantment of exactly level 17 is likely to be quicker than obtaining an enchantment of any level from 38 to 50 (requiring on average 6.4 attempts, as opposed to 7.4 attempts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sort of behaviour will be familiar to all players who make use of higher enchantments. What is more useful is to use the distributions to calculate the optimum number of bookshelves to maximise the probability of being offered an enchantment of a specific level. This is quite easy to do, and the results are shown in Table 1. Oscillations in the distributions of the top and middle slots are caused by the rounding error after multiplying by the slot factor, and these play a small but important role in the calculation (for an example, level 14 is most easily obtained with 22 bookshelves, while level 15 requires just 21).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: Optimum number of bookshelves for specific enchantment levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin:0 auto; width:60%;"&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=2 width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:60%;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Level &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td style="text-align: center; width:40%;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Bookshelves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   2 and below &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  0  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   3  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  1  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   4  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  3  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   5  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  5  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   6  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  7  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   7  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  9  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   8  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  11  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;   9  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  12  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  10  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  14  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  11  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  15  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  12  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  18  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  13  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  19  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  14  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  22  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  15  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  21  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  16  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  26  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  17  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  25  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  18  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  27  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  19 and up &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  30  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This phenomenon is not present when using Etho's variable bookshelf design. In this case, the optimum number of bookshelves to use is 2 for levels 4 and below, 9 for levels 5 to 8, 16 for levels 9 to 12, 23 for levels 13 to 17, and 30 for levels 18 and above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1714376694893899071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1714376694893899071&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1714376694893899071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1714376694893899071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-enchantment-level-bookshelf.html' title='On the Enchantment Level - Bookshelf Dependency in Minecraft'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDU1S5zyYOQ/TvBKhsu5e2I/AAAAAAAAAbc/ea8a8p55SI8/s72-c/Probability%2Bof%2Boffered%2Blevel%2Bsmall%2B2.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3328618955993909967</id><published>2011-12-12T13:16:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-01-17T08:39:10.972+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><title type='text'>On the Imminent Loss of the Ultimate Kitchen Instrument</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="readmore" style="float:right; padding:20px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" width="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fi_gYNw-4eI/TuXYybbt8fI/AAAAAAAAAa0/l9h-8Q2hGWc/s400/shears.PNG" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[A picture stolen from &lt;a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/RARE-Tullen-All-Purpose-Snips-Shears-Discontinued-NEW-/270513925143?pt=UK_Kitchen_Accessories&amp;hash=item3efbe2ec17#ht_1119wt_879"&gt;ebay.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;Growing up, I always took the set of Tullen Shears (pictured right) mounted on our kitchen wall for granted. They could (and did) cut through almost anything, and I simply assumed that everyone had a pair. Unfortunately, over the last couple of years or so, they have been getting progressively less sharp. This is not that surprising, considering what they have had to cut through in their almost 29 year life: virtually everything, including plastic, cardboard, tin cans, chicken bones, a couple of pairs of sunglasses, and a glass window pane. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Ironically, the one thing that it could never make a clean cut through was paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shears still work, they don't cut through some things (like plastic) quite as neatly as they once did, so we have been looking for a replacement pair for a while now. This has unfortunately been unsuccessful. After turning to the great power of the internet for an answer, we found (with some digging, in a forum dated five years ago, from someone claiming to be the daughter of the inventor of the shears) that Tullen New Zealand was sold to an English company in the late 1980s and they stopped making the shears shortly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was surprised that no one had ever seen the gap in the market and come up with shears that could match those once made by Tullen, but gradually it began to make sense to me.

One of those facts is that it is more economical (not to mention less frustrating for other drivers on the road) to maintain a constant speed while driving along a straight road.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Despite this, some drivers tend to enjoy accelerating the car to its top speed on the downhill sections of the road, and then let the car's momentum carry it up the following uphill at a much slower speed. This is a horribly inefficient way of driving, and I am going to attempt to explain why now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a very simplified consideration of a car, kinetic energy (or speed) is gained primarily from two sources, and mostly lost in two ways. The car gets extra kinetic energy by burning fuel, or by losing altitude. That is, if the car starts at the top of a hill, then without burning any fuel, it can start moving, simply because it is on a downward slope. The car loses energy to aerodynamic drag (and friction and a bunch of other things, but at fast speeds, drag is the most important), and by gaining altitude. A car slows down much quicker on an uphill than on a flat road. These things are obvious to most drivers, I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general idea for maintaining a constant speed is to balance the energy you gain from going down the slope with the energy from burning fuel. That is, you ease off on the accelerator on the downhills, and accelerate harder on the uphills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the irrational behaviour. Some drivers, for some reason, like to put all the energy into the car at once, i.e. accelerate only on the downhills. It is very simple to show why this doesn't work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider a road that consists of a 50/50 distribution of uphill and downhill slopes of equal gradient. Now consider two drivers: one who goes as fast as he can on the downhills, say 120 km/h, but then goes much slower on the uphills, say 80 km/h; and a second who maintains a constant speed of 96 km/h. We will assume that the uphill and downhill stretches are relatively long, and that the first car changes speeds quickly (so that we can neglect the time spent accelerating and decelerating). The advantage of these numbers is that for a journey of say, 6 km (which I chose for the round numbers it gives), both cars will take exactly the same time to reach the destination, that is 125 seconds. We will also assume that there are equal numbers of up and downhills, so that the starting point and destination are at the same altitude - this just makes the calculations a bit simpler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference comes into the power that the cars lose through aerodynamic drag, since this power lost is proportional to the cube of the velocity (that is, a car doing twice the speed will lose eight times the power to aerodynamic drag). So while the drag of the first car is 30.6% lower on the uphills than that of the second car, it is 56.3% higher on the uphills. The result of this extra drag is that the first car loses 12.8% more energy to drag than the second car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a specific quantity of fuel will release a specific amount of energy when it is burnt in the engine, this means that the car that accelerates hardest on the downhills will need to burn 12.8% more fuel throughout the journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up, a car that accelerates to 120 km/h on downhills but only does 80km/h on the uphills will use 13% more fuel than a car that holds a constant 96km/h, but arrive at it's destination at exactly the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3111713894775094192/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3111713894775094192&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3111713894775094192'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3111713894775094192'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-irrational-driving-part-1-only.html' title='On Irrational Driving Part 1: Only Accelerating on the Downhills'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2113563045298081373</id><published>2011-12-01T07:50:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-11-08T20:59:17.909+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fiction'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NaNoWriMo'/><title type='text'>On NaNoWriMo Part IV: Type IV</title><content type='html'>Even though I did not finish, I would call National Novel Writing Month 2011 a success from my point of view. I managed to write over 16 days in November, and put out 22 186 words (or 44% of the novel's minimum length) - my contribution to the more than three billion words written worldwide. This is a big increase over NaNoWriMo 2010, during which I managed to write a total of 4 607 words.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won't be giving you a full novel, because I have decided over the course of the next few months, I will be finishing it. It will be released as a free e-book under a Creative Commons license as soon as it is finished (and hopefully proof read and edited too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel, is titled &lt;i&gt;Type IV&lt;/i&gt;(Working Title) is set in a world very similar to the world inhabited by &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/on-nanowrimo-part-ii-on-barghest.html"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt; of last year's novel, and &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/01/on-as-yet-unrealised-evolution-of.html"&gt;Sarieth&lt;/a&gt; of this blog's opening post. It is a world that may or may not be our own, long after a technological civilisation, which may or may not be us, has fallen and receded. The story centres on our descendants who are living in and around the ruins of ancient cities. The story centres on two characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amser is an extremely gifted girl who is obsessed with discovering things. Although the sciences of the ancients are long since forgotten in the isolated city in which she was born and raised, she is a genius when it comes to inventing. Her true gift however, is chemistry. Through a childhood of trials and experiments, she has learned how to create a vast range of mixtures and chemicals that can perform a whole range of apparently magical functions. These lead her to discover ways to temporarily restore books left behind by the ancients, and she explores the world, absorbing knowledge, and applying it where she can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Llyr, aka Pedran, aka Elhaearn, is a man who is being hunted by the Company - a corrupt private law enforcement agency that has the entire country under its terrifying rule, much like the rule of Llyr's father (self-appointed lord of the city of Pyr, notorious pirate and marauder, and insidious conman) had once had over those very same people. Hunted in exile, he is searching for these mysterious creatures that have been prophesied to be the ones to bring freedom from tyrannous rule to his country. Funnily enough, he finds that these creatures have a very strange connection with the foreign girl, Amser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here's a short extract:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="padding: 0px 40px;"&gt;“This guy saved our lives back there. Don’t they have names?” he asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amser shrugged. “Not really. I’m not good with names. I call that one Type I,” she said, pointing to the smaller of the bird-creatures upon whose back Llyr was now sitting. “I call this one here Type IV.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In that case, I’m going to call this one Sion. Strong name. Means ’saviour’.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amser laughed. “I’m sticking with Type IV. Accurate name. Means the fourth combination of ingredients that worked.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then because I have the habit of graphing things (more for show than for actual information),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="223" width="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qJwHw9JBna8/TtciNADXBgI/AAAAAAAAAaE/auCrEAzqz0M/s400/averages%2Bgraph.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="299" width="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ukklduFYyeA/TtcirBmXejI/AAAAAAAAAao/Y7UJJI62Py4/s400/running%2Btotal.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="176" width="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sR2QTc2Yk24/TtciNhMInMI/AAAAAAAAAac/yRu20i3rFHU/s400/wpd%2Bgraph.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, since I promised you at least part of a novel, you can have a prologue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em; padding:0px 20px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:200%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prologue: The Girl Who Explored&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: x-large;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;AREFULLY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;, using a sharp, flat piece of metal, the girl pried the small square concrete slab out of place. Once it was loose, she began to lift it, ever so slowly, keeping it absolutely straight. As soon as it was clear of the slabs around it, she tossed it through the battered doorway where it joined a pile of other identical slabs. The girl let out a sigh of relief. The faint rust outline of a key was just visible on the coarse cement base beneath. She removed a thin square of paper from a wooden box she had taken out of her coat pocket and placed it over the outline. From a small glass bottle in the box, she poured a clear pungent chemical over the paper and then blew over it. The red outline of the key was gradually drawn through the paper. She mixed two more chemicals from the box in a small vial and poured the silver mixture into the area within the outline. Within seconds, it was glowing red hot, the paper curling in the heat. The girl was ready with a bottle of water as soon as the paper caught alight. Once the billowing steam had cleared, she lifted a rough key from the floor. After quickly filing the burs from the key, she placed it in a pocket of her coat, together with her wooden box, and after a nervous glance at the window, hurried out of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several hours later, she was several stories underground at the bottom of a narrow and broken flight of concrete stairs that had apparently been ineffectually repaired with wooden planks a number of times in their long history. Panting from moving some of the concrete slabs from the rooms above all the way down to bridge missing steps, she began to search her pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She quickly found what she was looking for. She removed two small vials, one containing a clear transparent liquid, and the other containing a thick orange gel. She rubbed a small bead of the gel over her left hand, and then allowed a tiny drop of the liquid to spill over it. She closed her eyes as the combination erupted into blinding blue flames, engulfing her entire hand. The flames resided in an instant, leaving just a glowing blue aura around her hand which cast a faint but sufficient light several metres around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was standing in a narrow stone passageway. The floor was slippery with moss, and the thick smell of damp hung in the air. She slowly advanced along the passageway. Every now and then, at somewhat irregular intervals, passageways identical to the one she was in would branch off to her left or right. Most of these she ignored, but every now and then, she would turn down one. After half an hour, the light emitted by her hand was no longer bright enough to show the path in front of her. She rubbed some more of the orange gel over her hand, and the light was restored. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, she approached a thick steel door. Here, the damp heavy air at the entrance had given way to a much dryer thin atmosphere. A thick layer of dust coated the floor and was thrown up by her feet as she passed. She stopped several meters away from the door, pulled a cloth over her nose and mouth, and moving very slowly, she pulled a small spray bottle from one of her pockets and began spraying a fine mist into the air. She waited while the dust settled, taking shallow breaths and exhaling very slowly. When the air was clear again, she moved forward, the dust remaining undisturbed bar a few faint foot prints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she reached the door, she examined it for several minutes. Finally, she fired a short burst of the mist from her spray bottle into the key hole, and then immediately blew into the lock. Out came her wooden box again --- this time so that she could take out a small bottle with a brush in the lid. She took out the key and painted over it with a thick red-grey grease. Slowly but forcefully, she slid the key into the lock, listening for each click as either the key or the catch in the lock gave way and sprang back into place. Once the key was fully in the lock, she sprayed it with a new bottle, this one containing a transparent fluid with a soft acrid smell which slowly ran out of the lock. She searched a coat pocket hurriedly for something, cursing under her breath when she couldn't find it. She eventually found what she was looking for in another pocket --- a small silver-grey rectangular stone. She held it a few inches away from the lock, and the fluid, stained slightly brown from grease, flowed towards the stone. She slowly moved the stone in a circular motion, spiralling first clockwise, and later reversing the direction. Once she had been round several times, she turned the key in the lock. With a loud grinding noise, the lock eventually turned. With a loud clang, the door was unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no shortage of resistance, and a deafening squeal of resistance from the long neglected hinges, she finally got the door open. She quickly moved into the room and pushed the door shut behind her. A smile slid across her face as she walked across the floor. The rough concrete roof was only just higher than her head, and lined with cables with long perished white rubber insulation. Every few meters, bare glass bulbs dangled from the ceiling, and where they were missing, shattered shards lay on the ground. The room extended further than she could make out and was filled with rows and rows of crude metal shelves, many of which had buckled under the weight of books they had held for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She made her way to the centre of the room, taking care not to disturb anything. Where a shelf had collapsed, or books had fallen, she changed rows to pass them, rather than disturb the fallen heap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she reached the room's centre, she took off the large tanks that she had strapped to her back and placed them on the floor. She untied a small mask that was attached to the one and fastened it across her face. She opened the valves on the two tanks, first on the one her mask was connected to, and then the other. A thick yellow mist filled the room. As the gas filled the room, she began to lift books of their shelves seemingly at random, spraying the liquid she had used earlier to settle the dust. Turning the rigid pages one by one, she began to read...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2113563045298081373/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2113563045298081373&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2113563045298081373'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2113563045298081373'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/12/on-nanowrimo-part-iv-type-iv.html' title='On NaNoWriMo Part IV: Type IV'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qJwHw9JBna8/TtciNADXBgI/AAAAAAAAAaE/auCrEAzqz0M/s72-c/averages%2Bgraph.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3114177345149405885</id><published>2011-10-31T10:11:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-12-01T09:03:37.205+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NaNoWriMo'/><title type='text'>On NaNoWriMo Part III</title><content type='html'>As I did last year, I will be taking part in &lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/dashboard"&gt;National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)&lt;/a&gt;.

The basic gamplay involves the player manipulating blocks in an effectively infinite 3D environment. The player controls an avatar that is capable of placing and removing blocks to create various structures, artworks or creations[1]. A significant part of the gameplay for the advanced player is farming for resources. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nether Wart was added to the game in the 1.9 pre-release, and is a plant which only grows in the Nether on Soul Sand [2]. Due to the importance of Nether Wart in potion brewing, and since it can only be grown in the Nether, optimum farming methods become necessary. After being planted, Nether Warts need to undergo two stages of growth in order to be fully grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Methodology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of this investigation is to determine the time for which Nether Wart should be left in order to maximise the number of seeds obtained in a given time period. It is useful to define our target variable as the net yield per plant, &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} Y }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} Y }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} Y }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, measured in seeds per hour. Freshly planted and half grown plants will yield a single seed, while fully grown plants will yield two to five seeds [2]. The distribution of the number of seeds dropped by a fully grown plant appears to be uniform, for an average of 3.5 seeds per plant. Thus the yield per plant per hour is given by the formula&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} Y = \frac{(p_0 @plus;p_1@plus;3.5p_2 - 1)}{t}}" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} Y = \frac{(p_0 +p_1+3.5p_2 - 1)}{t}}" title="\bg_black {\color{White} Y = \frac{(p_0 +p_1+3.5p_2)}{n}}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;where &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} p_k }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} p_k }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} p_k }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; represents the probability that the  plant has undergone &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} k }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} k }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} k }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; growth cycles, and &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} t }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} t }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} t }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the actual time in hours since the seed was first planted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The algorithm the game applies when checking for growth is as follows [3]. The game runs through an update cycle (I avoid the word tick, due to confusion with redstone ticks) every twentieth of a second. Each cycle, the game checks twenty random blocks in each loaded chunk for updates. A chunk is a 16 x 16 square with the full 128 block height of the world, and consists of 32 768 blocks. Thus the probability of a certain block being checked for updates is 20 in 32 768, or 0.061%. If a Nether Wart that is not fully grown is chosen to be checked for updates, then the probability of it growing to the next stage is one in 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} n }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} n }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} n }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; update cycles, the probabilities of the plant being at each stage of growth is given by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} p_0 = \left ( 1-x \right )^n }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} p_0 = \left ( 1-x \right )^n }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} p_0 = \left ( 1-x \right )^n }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} p_1 = n \left ( 1-x \right )^{n-1} }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} p_1 = n \left ( 1-x \right )^{n-1} }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} p_1 = n \left ( 1-x \right )^{n-1} }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} p_2 = 1-\left(p_0 @plus; p_1 \right ) }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} p_2 = 1-\left(p_0 + p_1 \right ) }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} p_2 = 1-\left(p_0 + p_1 \right ) }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;where &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} x }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} x }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} x }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the probability of a plant growing in any given update cycle, which is given by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} x = \frac{1}{32768 \times 15} }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} x = \frac{1}{32768 \times 15} }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} x = \frac{1}{32768 \times 15} }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a certain time &lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} t }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} t }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} t }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in hours, the number of update cycles that have been applied are &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bg_black {\color{White} n = t \times 20 \times 3600 }" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bg_black {\color{White} n = t \times 20 \times 3600 }" title="\bg_black {\color{White} n = t \times 20 \times 3600 }" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this, it is possible to calculate the expected yield per hour per plant for a farm that is harvested an replanted at regular specified intervals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yield per hour per plant was calculated for various time intervals. Exact agreement was found for the probabilities of various stages of growths with the work of Pernsteiner [3]. The probabilities of a plant being at each stage of growth and the resulting yield per hour per plant is shown in Table 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: Yield per hour per plant at various times after planting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Time &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fresh Plant &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Half Grown &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fully Grown &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Net Yield &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1 s   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 99.92%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.08%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.00%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.00   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 30 s   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 97.58%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  2.38%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.03%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.08   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 95.23%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  4.65%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.12%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.17   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 5 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 78.33%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 19.12%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  2.54%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.76   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 10 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 61.37%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 29.97%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  8.67%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1.30   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 20 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 37.67%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 36.78%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 25.56%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1.92   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 30 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 23.11%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 33.86%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 43.03%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.15   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 35 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 18.10%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 30.94%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 50.95%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.19   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 40 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 14.18%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 27.70%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 58.12%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.18   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 50 min  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  8.70%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 21.25%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 70.05%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2.10   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1 hour  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  5.34%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 15.65%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 79.01%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1.97   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2 hours  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.28%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  1.67%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 98.04%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1.22   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4 hours &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.00%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;  0.01%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 99.99%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.62   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are plotted in Figure 1 below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L5UlpmGbw18/TqlhFsveRkI/AAAAAAAAAZE/zhUfikgPEHE/s1600/yield.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="332" width="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L5UlpmGbw18/TqlhFsveRkI/AAAAAAAAAZE/zhUfikgPEHE/s400/yield.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; Plot of net yield per hour against time&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure 1 shows a maximum yield at 36 minutes and 43.6 seconds. However, the relatively flat gradient between 25 and 50 minutes would suggest that any time within this range would provide a reasonable yield. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The method with the highest yield would obviously be to monitor the farm constantly and manually harvest and replant those plants that are fully grown, but leave those that have not yet started to grow. However, the method of harvesting all plants at once lends itself to large or automated farms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above analysis does not account for the fact that a farm would take a finite amount of time to plant. Assuming a planting rate of about two plants per second, a 16 x 16 farm would take just over two minutes to plant. Because of this, the first plants two be planted would have had roughly two minutes longer to grow than the last plants to be planted. This should be accounted for when harvesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tempting to spread the farm over several chunks. This has absolutely no effect on the growth rate, as each block still has the same 0.061% chance of being selected for update, regardless of which chunk it is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expected outcome for the net yield of a Nether plant after a certain time period is easily calculated using statistics. A formula to calculate the probability of a Nether Wart having reached its first and second stages of growth respectively was developed and was then used to calculate the length of time that an Nether Wart farm should be allowed to grow to maximise the yield in a certain time period. The optimum time between harvests was found to be 36 minutes and 43.6 seconds, but any time period between 25 and 50 was found to be reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

You can play it in your browser &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I strongly recommend downloading the client from &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;br /&gt;[Editors Note #2: While the analysis in this article is still valid, the addition of abandoned mines in version 1.8 makes the use of existing shafts in these mines the most efficient mining technique and is far safer than spelunking, provided the cave spiders are avoided.]&lt;br /&gt;[Editors Note #3: With the addition of enchantments to the game, a player can obtain 120% more diamonds through the use of Fortune III, and can mine 300% more blocks with Unbreaking III. This makes mining for diamonds even more efficient than before.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I take a very thorough and calculated approach to almost everything in life, and the game of Minecraft is no exception. As a result, I have decided to take a very scientific approach to the development of an efficient mining technique. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a very early side note: my advice to you is to not take any technique that recommends the use of stone pick axes seriously, as iron is definitely common enough to make all tools, buckets and doors from iron, and still have enough left over to make an extensive minecart system. Furthermore, there are just enough diamonds in the game to justify using a diamond pickaxe for all but the most detailed construction projects.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This study presents an analysis of various Minecraft mining techniques. A quantifiable mining efficiency is defined and compared for 24 different mining techniques. Spelunking proved to be the most efficient technique, involving no mining in order to reveal resources, while large scale open-pit mining was the least efficient, as it required mining every single block. The optimum compromise between safety and efficiency is offered by slope mining at a 71.6° angle for iron and coal, and branch mining with two block high tunnels for diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game of Minecraft is an open sandbox construction game created by Markus "Notch" Persson. The basic gamplay involves the player manipulating blocks in an effectively infinite 3D environment. The player controls an avatar that is capable of placing and removing blocks to create various structures, artworks or creations[1]. There are two primary elements to gameplay - these being the placing of blocks, called "building", and the destruction of blocks, called "mining". In general, mining includes the act of destroying blocks that are automatically generated ("spawned") within the games environment in order to obtain resources that may be placed as is, or crafted into other objects which may be placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most common blocks are stone and dirt, which vastly outnumber other more useful blocks such as coal, iron, gold, diamond and redstone ores. Due to the large surplus in supply of the common blocks and the limited storage space available, mining stone or dirt unnecessarily is usually avoided. In addition to this, the act of mining takes a significant amount of time which is mostly wasted if useful resources are not being generated. Since the world in the game is essentially infinite, but the amount time a player spends playing is limited by constraints of every day life, there is a great advantage to using a technique which involves a minimal mining, but maximises the number of useful resources obtained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Methodology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to make any direct comparison of mining techniques, we need to define a quantifiable "mining efficiency" that can be meaningfully applied to any technique, and that allows for a conclusive comparison between mining techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous work has had a tendency to place emphasis on not missing any ores within the mining region [2,3]. Contrary to popular belief, the distribution of diamonds within a world is not completely randomly, but is in a manner that is biased towards a more uniform distribution (that is, each chunk is given an opportunity to spawn a single diamond vein only once). Thus, it is safe to assume for our analysis that diamonds are approximately uniformly distributed throughout the world (at the correct depths, of course). This would imply that all blocks in suitable locations have the same probability of containing a certain resource. Strictly speaking, this is not true, but it is still a very close approximation. It follows from this that the quantity of resources found by a particular mining technique will be directly proportional to the number of bocks that the technique reveals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most efficient mining technique would be a technique that reveals blocks without having to mine any blocks at all. Similarly, the least efficient technique would involve mining absolutely every block. A suitable equation for the efficiency can be derived by applying a linear variation between these two limits.

Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several classes of mining techniques that need to be considered. These include&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spelunking&lt;/b&gt; or cave diving, which involves exploring naturally occurring caves in order to find exposed resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open-pit mining&lt;/b&gt;, which involves mining out every block in a deep pit of a certain size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Branch mining&lt;/b&gt;, which involves mining long straight tunnels from a central hub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slope mining&lt;/b&gt;, which is similar to branch mining, but the tunnels are dug along a downward slope at a certain angle from horizontal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cutting&lt;/b&gt;, which involves mining long, narrow slits into the surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the majority of these techniques, the efficiency of the technique depends on the scale at which it is implemented. The efficiencies for each technique at various scales is shown in Table 1 below. The table is sorted from the most to least efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: Summary of efficiencies for various techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="50%" style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Technique &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Blocks Mined &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Blocks Revealed &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Efficiency &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Spelunking      &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 100.0% &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 1x1    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 80.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Slope mining, 71.6°, 5 high  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 5  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 16  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 76.2%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Branch mine, 2 high    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 6   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 75.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Slope mining, 63.4°, 4 high  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 12  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 75.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, 1 deep     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 75.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Slope mining, 26.6°, 2 high  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 5  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 14  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 73.7%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Branch mine, 3 high    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 8   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 72.7%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Slope mining, 45°, 3 high  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 8   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 72.7%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Branch mine, 4 high    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 10  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 71.4%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, 2 deep     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 5   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 71.4%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Branch mine, 6 high    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 6  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 14  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 70.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, 4 deep     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 9   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 69.2%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, 6 deep     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 6  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 13  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 68.4%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, 8 deep     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 8  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 17  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 68.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 2x2    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 8   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 66.7%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cutting, very deep    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 66.7%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 3x3    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 9  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 12  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 57.1%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 4x4    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 16   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 16  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 50.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 6x6    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 36   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 24  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 40.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 8x8    &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 64   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 32  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 33.3%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 16x16   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 256  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 64  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 20.0%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, 32x32   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1024 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 128 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 11.1%  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open-pit mining, large-scale  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0.0%   &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Table 1 clearly shows that the most efficient technique is spelunking, followed by 1x1 open-pit mining. Spelunking is indeed the most efficient mining technique, especially after the Beta 1.2 update, which increased the amounts of iron, diamond and coal in caves [4]. However, spelunking has several disadvantages, including a greatly increased risk of encountering hostile mobs and a significant risk of getting lost. It relies heavily on natural cave systems, placing the player at the mercy of the randomly generated map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open-pit mining in a 1x1 pit (which is the equivalent of mining narrow vertical shafts) is the second most efficient technique at 80%, but is the most dangerous technique. It involves an exceptionally high risk of mining through the ceiling of a tall cave, or mining into a pool of lava. Both cases are likely to involve death, and it is either very difficult or impossible to reclaim your items should this occur. This is the primary reason for the often quoted "Never dig straight down" slogan. The efficiency of open pit mining drops rapidly as the size of the pit increases. For a 2x2 pit, the efficiency drops to 66.7%, and tends towards 0% as the size of the pit increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slope mining at a 71.6° angle (as shown in Figure 1) is the optimum combination of efficiency and safety. The angle of 71.6° is the steepest angle that can safely be dug without mining the block that the player is standing on. This technique is ideally suited for coal and iron mining, but is not suited for diamond mining, due to the rapid rate of decent, which will reach the lava or bedrock layers within a few iterations of the method when starting from one of the diamond layers. The primary disadvantage is that this technique requires a minimum of 0.4 ladders per block mined in order to exit the shaft. An alternative is to fill in at least two blocks for every five block high section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="163" width="152" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v1NZkkTq8lo/Tm3XKoDtHxI/AAAAAAAAAY4/EnWkgVmMbn4/s400/Slopemining71p6.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; Example of slope mining at an angle of 71.6°&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more suitable mining method for mining diamonds is the branch mining technique. The higher the tunnel, the lower the efficiency of the technique, so it is advantageous to keep the tunnel height to the minimum height along which the player can walk, i.e. two blocks. At 75%, the efficiency of this technique is only marginally lower than that of 71.6° slope mining. Since all mining is carried out at a constant depth, it is possible to mine very long branches, increasing quantity of resources that may be collected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, spelunking is the most efficient mining technique. However, in the absence of suitable natural caves, or if the player deems the risk to be unacceptably high, then mining downwards along a 71.6° slope proves to be the optimum combination of efficiency and safety when mining for coal or iron. When mining for diamonds, a branch mining technique involving tunnels of a height of two blocks is the most effective method out of those investigated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

The one I have used maybe twice in the two years since my final exams at University. In fact, I am not even sure if it still works.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  (Note: I just checked. It does work. It just needs a whack against the desk to get the display to turn on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing with calculators is that people tend to take them for granted. I have learnt the hard way that they are vastly overrated. During test and exams, both at school and university, students were required to take out the stationery that they would need, and leave their bags at the back of the venue. Since I've always had a tendency to take the more mathematical subjects, The majority of exams I have written have required a calculator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I remember forgetting to take my calculator out was during an accounting exam in high school. As soon as I realised that I had forgotten, I thought of raising my hand and asking if I could go fetch it, but something inside me saw it more as a personal challenge, and that raising my hand would be giving up. Instead, I wrote the exam without my calculator, doing all the adding in my head and doing the more complicated depreciation and interest calculations in the margins. Somehow, I managed an A for that exam, and I felt immensely more proud of myself than I would have if my calculator had done half the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years later, sitting done for my mid-year physics exam at university, I realised that I had not taken a calculator out of my bag. (The irony was that I had by that time started carrying a spare calculator to exams, just in case one stopped working.) Once again, I considered raising my hand, but something in me was excited about the challenge. This time however, the calculations were somewhat more challenging than mere addition and subtraction. Many of them involved trigonometric functions and square roots - the sorts of calculation I cannot easily work out on a piece of paper without considerable time. Needless to say, I failed the exam completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story, I guess, is that I should not listen to the little voices in my head that get excited whenever something challenging comes up. The only problem is that I don't think I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6082894920396424066/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6082894920396424066&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6082894920396424066'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6082894920396424066'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/08/on-calculators.html' title='On Calculators'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-288663007847989505</id><published>2011-08-22T07:49:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-08-22T08:10:36.303+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='awkward situations'/><title type='text'>On Making Telephone Calls</title><content type='html'>I am a little shy in some situations. I have no problem getting up in front of a crowded room and talking, but some things make me extremely nervous. Telephone calls, for example. When receiving them, I have to take a couple of deep breaths to psych myself up before picking up the phone.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; During the conversation, I'll usually limit myself to yes or no answers, even in cases where it doesn't really answer the question asked. I often find myself saying goodbye prematurely, typically several times before the conversation actually comes to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far worse than receiving phone calls is making them. In general, I try keep most contact - both business and personal - to emails, texts and instant messaging. On those rare occasions when I receive the dreaded email, "Please contact me on 012 345-6789", my pulse starts to rise, and sweat instantly appears in the palms of my hands. After taking several deep breaths, I get up and walk to my phone. After several more deep breaths while just standing there, I go back to my computer, just in case I see a message, "Never mind, we can sort it out over email", which I have to date never received. I go back to my phone, sit down and start dialling the number. Before I finish, I cancel the call, and go to the toilet to empty my bladder. When I get back, I check my email again, still hoping for them to change their mind. Finally, I resign to the fact that I'll have to make the call, and just get on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I don't have to do it often. I can get away with making as few as three or four phone calls a year, including calls to my family, girlfriend and friends. Fortunately the age where phone calls are a daily necessity has passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/288663007847989505/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=288663007847989505&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/288663007847989505'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/288663007847989505'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/08/on-making-telephone-calls.html' title='On Making Telephone Calls'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1879788504503187512</id><published>2011-08-16T08:12:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-08-16T08:14:50.689+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Very Scary Social Nature of the Future</title><content type='html'>I grew up reading a lot of science fiction.

I have yet to see this done with any real effect. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; In most cases, especially in a bag that is rather heavy, this little piece of tape is not enough to hold the bag closed any longer than 30 seconds. This is extremely awkward for me. It is like an unwritten agreement between you and the security guard at the door that you are allowed in the store only on condition that the bag be sealed by their tape. I feel compelled to honour that agreement and often have to resort to holding the bag in an awkward manner in order to reduce the strain on the tape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, however, the guard at the door had used the tiniest piece of tape imaginable to tape shut one of the fullest bags I had carried in a while. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to keep the bag sealed, and I eventually gave up after the tape tore down the middle. With visions of a number of armed guards pouncing on me to escort me out of the store, I clutched the bag in a way that obscured the torn tape from view. Eventually, at the till, I had to get my wallet out of my pocket. Without thinking, I removed my hand, and the security guard &lt;i&gt;saw the broken seal&lt;/i&gt;. I know she saw it - she was staring directly at it. And yet she did absolutely nothing. I walked out of the store, and tried to nod acknowledgement at her in and inconspicuous manner, and she did nothing. I had always believed that the tape was there to prevent you from shoplifting by putting items in the bag and claiming you had bought them at another store, but considering the evidence against that hypothesis, I am not so sure now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of sealed bags and security, I am highly upset with the man at the security check at a certain UK airport who decided that the knotted heavy duty butcher bag that I had put my deodorant in was inadequate. He insisted that I actually &lt;i&gt;pay&lt;/i&gt; for one of their inferior resealable plastic bags. I felt like explaining that the so called "seal" on such a bag is to stop solid objects from falling out, and is not water tight. I would not be impressed if the deodorant leaked (which mine tend to be prone to doing) all over my bag. In any other circumstance, I may even have explained this, but fortunately I remembered an important rule that I try to live by - keep on security's good side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5462942087289472197/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5462942087289472197&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5462942087289472197'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5462942087289472197'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/07/on-security-measures.html' title='On &quot;Security Measures&quot;'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8045882274067762035</id><published>2011-07-14T07:12:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-04T21:37:30.464+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On an Official Sort of Announcement Part II</title><content type='html'>Due to me flying ten thousand kilometres from home to present a paper at a conference (read free overseas holiday), there will be no posts until at least the 24th of July.

Every time you see them, some are just wondering around slowly, but most are simply standing there, looking around, but trying extremely hard to not focus on anything in particular.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are smart, you will pretend not to have noticed them, and just carry on with your business and try not to think about it any more. However, if you are unfortunate enough to have no control over what your brain chooses to think about (like me), your mind will immediately jump to one of a number of conclusions. One possible conclusion is the "secret service" option, and you may wonder which foreign head-of-state is currently visiting. If you like conspiracy theories, you may think "cover-up". Another possible conclusion that you may jump to is the "mafia" option - somewhere in the middle of that group, someone possibly has a shovel and is busy disposing of a body or two. The rest are just standing around to block the makeshift grave from view. There are few other explanations, especially during a raging blizzard, and most of them arouse suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is for this very reason that I cannot bring myself to trust penguins. I mean, I like them. They are extremely cute and all that, but I would never leave my car keys where a penguin could reach them, and I most certainly would not let one into my house for any reason. Their general behaviour and actions are just far to suspicious for them to be up to any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7447428647486544043/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7447428647486544043&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7447428647486544043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7447428647486544043'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/07/on-rather-disturbing-thought.html' title='On a Rather Disturbing Thought'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-170140296907105223</id><published>2011-06-27T13:47:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:06:00.302+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Games of Logic</title><content type='html'>Very early on in my school career, I showed practically no mathematical ability (possibly due to a boring teacher, combined with a bit of ADD, my annoyingly slow brain with very little capacity when it comes to short term memory).&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; At the age of around 8 or 9, I began to show an aptitude for maths that was somewhat higher than most kids of my age (probably around the time when maths became about working things out rather than memorising multiplication tables). As a result, my teacher recommended that I join the schools chess team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a remarkably common misconception that people who are good at mathematics are good at chess. This is not true at all - to be good at chess requires two abilities: pattern recognition, and enough memory to hold a decision tree consisting of all possibilities for at least the next three of your turns . My pattern recognition is only average, and my memory has difficulty in holding even the moves available in the current turn. No surprises then that I landed up at the bottom of the team. I still cannot understand how people associate chess with a mathematical ability. It is merely a combinatorial game, and it's difficulty arises due to the shear number of posible locations for all of the pieces on the board. Also, chess requires very little in terms of reading your opponent, because it almost always safe to assume that your opponent will choose from a limited set of "good" moves that will lead to either an improvement in position or an advantage within three to five moves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, in high school, mathematics was a prerequisite for computer programming. This is something else I could not understand. Programming requires only one skill: the ability to break a problem down into a set of smaller problems - something which helps, but is not essential, for mathematics. There are many people I've met who are exceptional programmers who struggle with maths, and there are many people who have no problem at university level maths who struggle with programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this shows is that no one actually knows what it takes to be good at mathematics.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/170140296907105223/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=170140296907105223&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/170140296907105223'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/170140296907105223'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/06/on-games-of-logic.html' title='On Games of Logic'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3536978839465969776</id><published>2011-06-21T10:20:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-06-21T10:20:33.186+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Google'/><title type='text'>On the Googles, Part X</title><content type='html'>The mysteries of Google's incredibly complex ranking formulae still evade me. In the mean time, I really enjoy the rather absurd Google queries that lead people to this site. For some obscure reason, almost 100 people a day pass over my blog in their Google search results. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  An impressive 20% of those are offered a link to my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/11/on-ring-around-sun.html"&gt;explanation of the 22° halo around the sun&lt;/a&gt;, with a third of those having searched for the term "sun diagram" (my average position on the search is around 160th). Hopefully those people were not disappointed with the answers they found. My nice little diagram often shows up on the first page of an image search for "sun halo diagram".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I enjoy reading the absurd searches that actually lead people to my blog. Apart from the incorrect spellings such as "alphanumeric sheep pid" (which occured on a number of different occasions) there are several interesting ones, such as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.mx/search?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphasheep.co.za%2F2010%2F07%2Fon-valve-to-spout-ratio.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=alfanumetric%20%20wash%20your%20hands%20solution&amp;ei=Oaa3TbP5IqbUiALbstU6&amp;usg=AFQjCNEH7px28rjOY1ms7FrA-phwKhk9ug"&gt;"alfanumetric wash your hands solution"&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphasheep.co.za%2F2011%2F01%2Fon-motor-driven-chain-of-stationary.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=%20motor%20%20driven%20moving%20pig%20targets&amp;ei=unXuTZyjFtOBtgfIm9G1CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIGZuVBc2tiKqqrMfZjukPYzDD6Q"&gt;"motor driven moving pig targets"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I can't help but be proud of showing up consistently somewhere around the 87th postition for a search for "depth perception problems", or for being in the search results for "communicating with aliens", "oversized floppy hat", "what does bunnies eat" and "five legged sheep". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, I'm proud of Bing, who have finally started indexing my blog over the past couple of months. I have actually shown up in obscure Bing searches such as "in the heat of the night", "googlesaga winter holidays", "google-history of pie birds", "the sheep and chicken head feet problem", "something involving words", "googledo termites have wings", "is a pig as smart as a human being" and "sheep eating rabbits". It is however alarming at how many searches on bing contain the word "google". That may be something Microsoft would want to look into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for the ramblings of some over-analytical, permanently bored engineer with a compulsive need to write absolute rubbish. I'm just disappointed that the penguins do not show up much. Or, perhaps that has been their plan all along.

Some cultures believe the other extreme - that the solstices and equinoxes mark the separation of the seasons. I disagree with both, simply because of this idea of having well defined seasons is stupid.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the winter solstice is hitting next week Tuesday (somewhere around quarter past seven in the evening), we are only just starting winter. Excluding the repeated buffeting from severe cold fronts, the weather has actually been warm enough to wander around with just a jeans and a T-shirt during the day. Each and every year, the real cold, where even the sun has no warmth, comes during July and August. It amazes me how people fail to notice this every year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, it is a common misconception that the solstices arrive on the same day each year. This is not true at all. In reality, it varies from year to year as the Earth follows its elliptical orbit, and its axial tilt does not change as the orbit moves around the sun. For example, the solstices this year are 20 March, 21 June, 23 September and 22 December (UTC), but next year they will fall on 20 March, 20 June, 22 September and 21 December (UTC, of course))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with this idea that rain in June being "unseasonal and unusual" - it is actually rather common, and happens at least one, if not two, out of three years. Cold fronts almost always carry a bit of rain with them. Around the end of May or beginning of June, the cold fronts are pushed far enough North, and bring a day or two of rains, and another half a week of icy weather and wind. It is just as bad as those who believe that September brings rain, when really, more often than not, the first spring rains only fall somewhere around the end of October (which I &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/09/on-shiny-silver-flying-pizza.html"&gt;wrote about before&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to work out the seasons is by using nature, rather than just forcing on arbitrarily defined definitions. In Johannesburg in particular, you know Autumn has started when the majority of trees start losing their leaves (usually late April, early May); winter has started when the sun has no warmth on a clear day (around mid June); spring starts when the trees start shooting their leaves (mid September); and summer starts when the sun is hot enough to burn the grass (late October), but there is a fuzziness of some sort for two to three weeks which make up the transition periods in between, and these can  move forward or backward by up to a month from year to year... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was 11 or so, I spent a lot of time developing a complex system of sixteen seasons, in which every sort of weather pattern was accounted for. In the end, I had to discard the whole idea on account of the fact that it did not resemble reality at all - something which most others unfortunately seem rather reluctant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Editor's note: Apologies for the rather late post due to technical errors - in this case a rather unfortunate configuration of synapses which have a tendency to fire electrical signals in such a way that it has lead to a case of chronic procrastination, even of tasks that themselves were originally meant as a form of procrastination.

Yet so often I find that things are designed for the most absurdly sized people. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I am not particularly fat (in fact, apart from the bit of padding I've gained around my belly in the last couple of years, I am actually quite scrawny). However, whenever I try on pants, the size that fits me around the waist is almost always far to long and extremely baggy. If I get the size that fits my leg length and diameter comfortably, then the waist circumference is usually a good 5 cm too short to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most confusing then, is that when I lie in bed and pull the duvet around my neck, I find that my feet stick out the bottom. I cannot work out how the standard length for a duvet was determined, but it was done wrong. How on earth people who are taller than me cope, I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the five adult shirt sizes available in the shops show that the standards (if they can be called that, as poorly defined as they are) are completely arbitrary...

My body produces heat at a more or less constant rate, coupled with some spikes every now and then which vary with the frequency of flatulence (I can't help it when I'm sleeping, OK?). &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very very far from an insomniac. I can (and have) managed to fall asleep in some of the most absurd places. However, I am occasionally (i.e. about 6 to 8 times a year) kept up by complex problems (surprisingly, these are only rarely work related). On this particular night, I could not fall asleep because I was too hot with my thick down duvet on, but too cold if I replaced it with my blanket. The compromise was to use the duvet, but with strategic holes left open to optimise cooling. But I'll get back to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary issue here is the human base metabolic rate, which is the energy that the human body generates whilst in a rest state. For an average human, it is between 50 and 75 W. It doesn't seem like much if you consider that the heater in my office is 1500 W, but in that tiny space, wrapped up by my super effective duvet, it is a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now consider the insulation provided by my duvet - an approximately 30 year-old 5 cm thick duvet stuffed with the down feathers of some unidentified (probably semi-aquatic) bird. It probably has a thermal conductivity of  (and I'm taking a completely well-educated stab in the dark here) somewhere around 0.03 W/(m.°C). Although the area of the duvet is 1.7 m², I estimate that only 1.2 m² actually has a person underneath, and isn't just resting on the sheets. Assuming the air around my body has all reached somewhere around my body temperature (37°C), and is at steady state (although it is not, it is adequate for these simple head calculations), and that the air outside is a freezing cold 10°C (which I could have checked, if I'd thought of it at the time, since I keep two thermometers next to my bed, and then one in the study across the passageway (although I can't remember the last time I looked at any of them)), then the net rate of heat leaking through the duvet is just 20 W, meaning that somewhere from a half to a third of the body heat I generate is trapped in my duvet, and goes to making me uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the same calculation on the 8 mm  thick synthetic and cotton blanket, and you get a heat leakage rate of 120 W. The perfect solution would be a duvet or blanket that lay somewhere between the two, but since that was not available, I had to work out the optimum size and location of a cooling vent. Here, the calculations proved to be not as simple, as the effectiveness of the cooling vents requires knowledge of the air flow in the room. Even though this is technically supposed to be my area of expertise, I am completely unaware of the frequency and strength of my night-time flatulence, so this was impossible for me to calculate. Instead, after setting up vents of various sizes and various locations and leaving them open for 5 or so minutes at a time, with little success (they resulted mostly in one part of my body being too cold, while the rest remained too hot), I decided that it would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I managed to squeeze in a pathetic 6 hours of sleep by pressing my knees (which seem to be rather resilient to temperature changes) against the wall, and using that as a heat sink to dump the extra thirty something watts of heat I was generating. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2050984625686540709/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2050984625686540709&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2050984625686540709'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2050984625686540709'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/06/on-efficiency-of-natural-night-time.html' title='On the Efficiency of Natural Night-time Heating'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-885417861031446370</id><published>2011-06-01T07:54:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-06-01T07:54:19.617+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertising'/><title type='text'>On Methods for Concealing Baldness and Other Such Nonsense.</title><content type='html'>If you are one of those that are still impressed when an advert claims that a certain product is patented or patent pending, with the belief that if it can be patented it must work, I have bad news for you...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;A prime example which most people are familiar with is &lt;a href ="http://www.google.com/patents?id=H4k5AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"&gt;US Patent number 4,022,227&lt;/a&gt;. If you are bald on top but fortunate enough to have extra length hair around the sides of your head, you could "conceal" the bald part by carefully folding your hair over the bald area to conceal it in the classic hairstyle known as the comb over. Everyone (except perhaps those who have a comb over) knows that the comb over is an instant notifier of baldness, and in may cases, looks even worse than if they had just left it. It looks almost as ridiculous as a toupée.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that anything can be patented, provided that you have the time to write out a well worded patent application, and the money to throw to the patent office. Perhaps more absurd is the inventor &lt;a href="http://www.humanai.com/"&gt;Mitchell Kwok&lt;/a&gt;, someone with enough spare money to splash out on no fewer than six patent applications for a time machine. His plan is remarkably well thought out. The basic principle came to him while playing &lt;i&gt;Prince of Persia&lt;/i&gt; on his PlayStation 2. Whilst playing the game, he came to the realisation that, in the video game world, the rules of time do not apply. He proposes programming human level artificial intelligence, and then letting these AIs loose in a video game environment where they can conduct research and develop an artificial intelligence that is much smarter than a human. He reasons that this would take humans 20 years to complete in the real world, but would take only a second in the video game world (an obvious sign that he has never used a computer to carry out research). It starts with &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090164397.pdf"&gt;US Patent Application number 2009/0164397&lt;/a&gt;, which claims&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"A method and system for creating exponential human artificial intelligence in robots, as well as enabling a human robot to control a time machine to predict the future accurately and realistically. The invention provides a robot with the ability to accomplish tasks quickly and accurately without using any time. This permits a robot to cure cancer, fight a war, write software, read a book, learn to drive a car, draw a picture or solve a complex math problem in less than one second."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this method recursively, he believes that each iteration of the AI will be exponentially smarter, and he will eventually land up with an intelligence thousands of times smarter than a human. He will then ask this AI very nicely to calculate the exact positions and velocities of every single particle on Earth (presumably anything more than Earth would be asking too much), in the past and future with "pinpoint accuracy", and store these in a database somewhere (hopefully on the moon to avoid the paradoxes associated with self-containing systems).

In memory of the death of the great Douglas Adams on the 11th of May 2001, and in celebration of the premier of the Star Wars episode IV on the 25th of May 1977, I’d like to remind every geek and nerd out there to remember to carry their towels with them tomorrow. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For does the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; itself not say: &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to- hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you never read the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; and don’t understand the significance of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" towel_day”="" wiki=""&gt;Towel Day&lt;/a&gt; do it for the sake of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" geek_pride_day”="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" wiki=""&gt;Geek Pride Day&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.

When people ask, I tell them that it is an inflatable safety device in case I fall into a lake. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;The real reason is simpler, but the full story is rather long-winded. I will give it a try, nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through school and for my undergraduate years at university, I carried only one bag around with me with all of my books as well as my lunch and juice. In high school, the sheer size of my bag earned me a bit of a reputation. Most people packed their bags in the morning or the night before, and only packed the books that they needed for that day. I was never the sort to be able to get into a routine (never mind have to work out what day it is, every single day), and after several occasions where I went to school taking books packed for the wrong day, I decided that such a system could never work. Instead, I adjusted the system to use terms instead of days. This way, I only needed to pack my bag with all of the books I would need in the next three months, and only needed to remember to do so every three months. (And although I often have difficult remembering what day yesterday was, I usually find it easier to remember which term the last one was (since three months does give it time to sink into my long term memory).)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at university, the books grew bigger, the distances between classes grew further, I grew lazier, and large bags grew more expensive. It did not take long for the immense compressive forces inside my bag to cause a bottle of grape juice to pop its lid – an accident which left my unfortunate chemistry textbook permanently disfigured (and stained pink, which I’m sure is the source of much teasing from the other books). Thanks to this (and one or two other close calls), I learned to leave my text books at home, and take only a notepad and some pencils with me to lectures, and then empty the previous days notes out when I got home. That way, I would lose at most one day’s work in case of a catastrophic leak. Unfortunately, by third year (which I reached in five years, due to my inability to decide what I what I want to be if I eventually grow up), I began to carry my laptop with me to classes, and still used only one bag. (Actually two on some days, because of the immense number of reference material that my aircraft design lecturer insisted we had with us all the time, but there was no way I was going to risk damaging the thousand odd pages of charts and tables and diagrams, so my laptop and lunch remained in one bag.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, when I did carry two bags, I had to tie them together. The awkwardness of having a piece of string to deal with every time you moved or pick up the bags was far preferable to realising that you had forgotten one bag somewhere several hours previously.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful, and for almost one and a half years my laptop survived sharing a bag with not just one juice bottle, but a half litre water bottle as well. However, one day (19 January 2010, before 11:24 am, judging by my facebook status update regarding the event), The water bottle, apparently jealous of the bag being dry inside, decided that the bag should carry half the water as well. I pulled out my sopping wet laptop, pulled out the keys and patted it down with toilet paper. (Very bad idea. It sticks to everything when it gets wet, and it turns out that removing the bits of toilet paper is a real mission.) Fortunately, the laptop made it through with absolutely no damage (apart from toilet paper stuck to the backs of one or two keys). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that day onwards, I have been carrying my juice and water bottles in a nice black cooler bag that my father once got for free at some company function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh... wait. That explains the black cooler bag, and not the neon green one, doesn’t it? I started carrying the neon green one several months before the laptop-water incident because the large bowls of leftovers that I regularly take for lunch don’t fit in the bag with my laptop, didn’t I? Ah, apparently it's not so long-winded after all.  &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/169981903336957916/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=169981903336957916&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/169981903336957916'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/169981903336957916'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/05/on-my-neon-coloured-inflatable-safety.html' title='On My Neon Coloured Inflatable Safety Device'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8198392993024629554</id><published>2011-05-09T16:47:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2012-03-27T11:37:20.459+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='philosophy'/><title type='text'>On Hypocrisy</title><content type='html'>The label “hypocrite” is often used in an insulting way, or as a means to discredit a person.

The biggest annoyance is that occasionally I hear the first couple of bars to a song, but my mind switches off before I can ever get to the rest of the song. The first few bars get stuck in my head, and I’m driven crazy because that’s where it stops every time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also frustrating are those parts in instrumental pieces (especially in classical music) where two (or more) instruments play opposing tunes. It is impossible to hum it mentally and get the exact tone. I spend hours trying to get the tone correct in my mind,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar thing happens when I hear a catchy song on the radio, and I only know one line. I can only repeat that line over and over in my head, and a sense of frustration creeps in when I can never make it past that line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying part, perhaps, is that the action of my mind playing songs back to me is completely involuntary. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5904346788197648378/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5904346788197648378&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5904346788197648378'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5904346788197648378'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/05/on-firmly-embedded-lyricless-music.html' title='On the Firmly Embedded Lyricless Music'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7087708692012173638</id><published>2011-04-21T08:10:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2012-02-06T12:26:34.072+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='time'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Undeniable Opposing Nature of Time</title><content type='html'>Your natural flow through time is to start off in the past, and move forwards into the future. From time’s reference frame, if you were to start off in the future and move to the past, then you’ll have moved backwards in time. So far, it’s simple and easy to follow. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Now let’s look at it from your reference frame. If time starts off ahead of you, and then flows to behind you, then time is considered to be flowing forwards. If it were to start off behind you and end up ahead of you, it would be said to have flowed backwards. If you start off in yesterday, and moved to tomorrow, you’d have moved forward in time, but if Wednesday, 20 April 2011 were to start off in yesterday and move to tomorrow, then time would have moved backwards. Therefore, time must be facing the opposite direction to you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7087708692012173638/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7087708692012173638&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7087708692012173638'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7087708692012173638'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-undeniable-opposing-nature-of-time.html' title='On the Undeniable Opposing Nature of Time'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4561895144514607545</id><published>2011-04-18T07:44:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:15:00.667+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='more or less nothing'/><title type='text'>On the Disabling Effect of a Sense of Fulfilment</title><content type='html'>Isn't it fascinating that a sense of achievement is an incapacitating emotion. Or is it just me? Whenever I accomplish something at work (and it needn't be anything big), I am overcome by an odd desire to tell everyone what I have managed to do, and show off a bit. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't help wondering what caused humans to evolve such an odd thing. Surely, after achieving something big, it is most productive to continue on and achieve something even bigger?  It reminds me of a scenario I read in a book a long time ago (I wish I could remember which book it was). If a taxi driver is having a very good day, then he will often reward himself by going home early. On the other hand, if he did not have many customers, he will often work late to reach a certain level of turnover. It is obvious, however, that he could obviously make a lot more money by working late on the busy days, and going off early on the quiet days, since his time is far more productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once worked during the evenings in a video store (for about two months), and the exact same thing happened. On busy days, if we had reached a certain level of sales for the day, the manager would close the store half an hour early. Statistically, the store was far more likely to have more customers during that last half an hour on the busy days than on quiet days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No surprises that this blog post was written last Friday morning, immediately after I had made a major breakthrough in a program I had been working on, and needed something to keep me occupied until lunchtime (since no one was around for me to show off to), and I was unable to concentrate enough to carry on with the rest of the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4561895144514607545/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4561895144514607545&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4561895144514607545'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4561895144514607545'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-disabling-effect-of-sense-of.html' title='On the Disabling Effect of a Sense of Fulfilment'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7907469859740054574</id><published>2011-04-12T14:24:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-12T14:24:49.207+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Abstract Bacon and a Spring Roll</title><content type='html'>And don’t forget the squawking featherless chicken that was tasting them. It truly was a magnificent site. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  It spanned well over four acres, and had once been surrounded by a twelve foot wall. It was only when a group of people got together, plucked out all of the chicken’s feathers, and began to tickle each of the wall’s twelve feet that the siege was finally ended. But that was years ago, and to this very day, the chicken is upset about having to remain cold throughout the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might ask why the chicken could not just buy a blanket, and unless you asked the chicken (or an acquaintance of the chicken) directly, you would risk receiving something along the lines of a blank stare, accompanied by some judgement about your mental health. For that reason, it is probably best not to ask the question of anyone (or anything, for that matter), other than the chicken himself. If you were to ask the chicken, the response would possibly include stunned silence, blatant ignoration, one or more isolated squawks, a series of clucks, or an aggressive attack. Whatever the chicken’s response, it is almost certain that it will not actually contain the answer to your question – that the chicken is unable to afford luxuries such as a blanket. Chickens are virtually unemployable, and when they are employed, they are reimbursed by means of shelter, protection from predators and dried grain – none of which are suitable tender for purchasing a blanket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chicken did indeed try several means of obtaining a blanket (or something similar), some legal and not, and landed himself in some serious trouble with the law. Fortunately, a good attorney managed to convince the judge that although chickens are not technically flightless, they are only capable of flying short distances at very low altitudes, and therefore do not usually present a flight risk. So, with a suspended sentence hanging over his head, the chicken gave up on his hopes of ever being warm for the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the bacon and spring roll came along. Both were sizzling hot, and the spring roll was wrapped in a thin but cosy blanket of a flour and water based batter. The chicken was almost certainly jealous, so temporarily forgetting his criminal record, he attacked them both. Inevitably, he began to chew on them (since claws and a beak are the only real weapons an unemployed chicken could have readily available). Naturally, the chicken was not disappointed in the taste, but since both the bacon and the spring roll were inanimate objects and incapable of vocalising their thoughts, the chicken never did find out how they had come to be so warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you ever come across a featherless chicken chewing on a piece of bacon, be sure to catch him and fry him. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7907469859740054574/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7907469859740054574&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7907469859740054574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7907469859740054574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-abstract-bacon-and-spring-roll.html' title='On Abstract Bacon and a Spring Roll'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2860939205683160345</id><published>2011-04-07T12:44:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-02-21T17:18:24.576+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fiction'/><title type='text'>On a Little Something Involving Pie</title><content type='html'>I'm not too sure where I get this stuff...

It was raining heavily, and his pastry coat was feeling rather soggy. It would take hours for it all to dry out properly and reach its correct crisp golden brown hue. Careful not to lean out of the small dry nook that the small refrigerated entrance hall formed, he dug in what might have been a pocket of sorts for his keys. Cursing the fact that his pie pockets were filled with a sloppy cinnamon apple chunks in a sticky caramel gravy, he eventually found his keys. Inserting them into the lock and turning them, he quickly glanced back over his crusted shoulder into the dark street behind. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapped in the faint atramentous warmth of his box apartment, he turned up the heating element. In the orange incandescence of the oven, One could make out a variety of crumbs, discarded cigarette butts and a single half eaten pizza slice trodden into the aged carpet. Two couldn’t make them out – his eyesight had been severely damaged in a car crash years ago. Three would have been able to make them out quite well, but he’d been dead close on six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Who’s there?” called Two, sitting up alert in his sofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last of the pie slices remained quiet. Skulking slowly across the room, he withdrew an old buckled stainless steel blade. A bald eagle fluttered on the window sill, startling the pie slice. The eagle tried to take flight, instead crashing into the pavement below as its featherless wings failed to make purchase on the thin air. Flapping wildly, it dashed across the lawn, and into a dividing fence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“God damn it!” screamed Four. “I was half way through disproving rational numbers as a closed number set under the division operation!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The fence was skew anyway, Six sat on it far too many times. Now shut up, I’m trying to sleep,” called Two unenthusiastically, before settling back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last of the pie slices stepped on the half eaten pizza slice, his foot suddenly coming into the limited field of vision that One could make out. Slightly hung over, but mostly still drunk, One called out, his words slurring together: “S’at yoo’ Three? S’at the ghost ofa d’parted quant’ty?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It was that damn bird,” mumbled Two. “Now shut up, I’m trying to sleep.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Nope, t’wasn’t a bird. Looked like... Wheres’a fence?” One asked, and promptly fell asleep. Slowly, the last pie slice slipped back into the shadows, moving around the back of the room. wiping his sticky caramel hand on some upholstery as he went. Swiftly, he guided his pie cutter through One’s throat. Barely a choke escaped before the rich cranberry juice slid across the floor. Pulling out a small pistol, he fired a single shot through the glass door, into Four’s back. And then turned rapidly to fire at Two, but Two was not there. He did not feel the blade of the sword that he could see sticking out of his chest. As his vision began to fade, he was vaguely aware of a calm thud that he could recognise as words, but his ability to comprehend them had already abandoned him. The last thought that crossed his mind was the fatal flaw in his otherwise perfect plan. Two was not completely blind, merely severely visually impaired. Eight’s plot to become the only pie slice had failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that, the last of the pie slices descended into pie hell, where he would be baked unevenly and at the wrong temperature for the rest of eternity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2860939205683160345/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2860939205683160345&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2860939205683160345'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2860939205683160345'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-little-something-involving-pie.html' title='On a Little Something Involving Pie'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1522385623517853058</id><published>2011-04-05T14:35:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:12:07.211+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='exercise'/><title type='text'>On the Fictional Nature of Isolated Thinking</title><content type='html'>I have always had the perception that other people think better when they sit still and concentrate on just thinking, but I've never had much luck thinking with nothing to keep the rest of me busy...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I guess my misconception came from actors trying to mimic thought on TV, and popular phrases like "sit and think". The only times I ever realised that the popular perception could be wrong was when my dad quoted "sometimes I sits and thinks, and sometimes I just sits". Most of the time, I just sit. If I need to think, I have to find something to keep the rest of me occupied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the easiest solutions, I found, was walking. I remember my brother and I having debates and discussions about a number of things before supper, and I would march in a circle around the dining room table, being careful to step in the centre of tiles in a precise pattern, because that was the only way I could get my mind to cooperate with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most of my life, I have done a lot of my best thinking while walking. Even though my most productive serious problem solving time is in the bath, it is only because I tend to walk on the spot while lying down in the bath. I also used to read a lot, and as I lay in bed reading, my legs would walk against the wall. My bedroom wall had two dark lines across it where my feet had scraped out my footsteps. For the brief time that my bed lay under a window, I put a leg through the glass on two separate occasions. One of the things which annoys my father more than anything else is the way I wander aimlessly around the house while brushing my teeth or combing my hair whenever I have anything worth thinking about (which is most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was 16 or so, I worked out how to solve a Rubik's cube - a huge step forward in my thinking ability. The solution is just an algorithm, and after solving three or four different permutations, I could do it subconciously. It works far better than walking. When I needed to concentrate for a while, I pick up and repeatedly shuffle and solve my Rubik's cube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I think of it, right now, my hands are occupied with constant typing, I'm rocking in my chair, and tapping my feet together... &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1522385623517853058/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1522385623517853058&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1522385623517853058'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1522385623517853058'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-fictional-nature-of-isolated.html' title='On the Fictional Nature of Isolated Thinking'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6347357944887475482</id><published>2011-03-30T07:12:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-30T07:12:08.087+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Murphy's Law...</title><content type='html'>... which simply states (with some manipulation) that if one were to come up with an important law about engineering design and treat it only with complete seriousness, then that law will be eternally misquoted and misapplied in a light-hearted manner. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly ironic that the aerospace engineer, Edward Aloysius Murphy, Jr., who came up with a serious law of defensive engineering design - stating that when designing something, one should always assume that the design will have to endure the worst possible scenario that could possibly occur - will always be cursed whenever an unconsidered worst case scenario occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever some plan goes wrong, and someone screams "Damn you, Murphy!", I can't help but wonder,  if old Murphy is up there watching, mumbling "Told you so..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6347357944887475482/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6347357944887475482&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6347357944887475482'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6347357944887475482'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-murphys-law.html' title='On Murphy&apos;s Law...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1384668384769075986</id><published>2011-03-28T07:34:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-03T15:03:38.099+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>On Not Matching Things</title><content type='html'>No doubt you have been in a sleepy mood one day and mistyped your email password, only to be told that your "username and password do not match". This happened to me the other day. Unfortunately, I was always taught that you should choose a password that was not the same as your user name. It's more secure that way.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; For that reason, I have never used Alphanumeric Sheep Pig in any of my passwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought that it might be some new security policy - make the password the same as your email so that it would be unique... Very smart... However, I couldn't access my email in order to change my password to match my username. Frustrated, I realised that this new policy would mean that anyone with your email address would know your password, but I was not prepared to assume that some programmer I have never met would have realised the same thing. As a result, I was beginning to write an angry letter (since I couldn't get into my email) to state exactly what I thought of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway through the letter, I decided to try logging in again, and this time my password worked. Looking back, I think that perhaps it was trying to tell me that I had entered either the username or password incorrectly, but if that was the case, then surely it would have just said so?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1384668384769075986/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1384668384769075986&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1384668384769075986'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1384668384769075986'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-not-matching-things.html' title='On Not Matching Things'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2869885367633245144</id><published>2011-03-24T12:33:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-24T12:37:29.130+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Puzzling Things</title><content type='html'>Here is a puzzle for you.

I guess it’s mainly that I have never managed to grasp people’s desperation for a certain team to win purely due to an arbitrary geographical connection, in spite of whatever odds may be for or against that team, and the pointless arguing and the contention that it inevitably initiates, especially amongst those whose role in the sport is limited to providing moral support.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I understand the appeal of being directly involved in a sport - the physical exercise, the sense of achievement (not just of winning, but of scoring points, or of coming close to winning), and the compulsive desire not to lose contribute to the release of endorphins which result in some degree of enjoyment for the players. For the fans, I think it's just a case of choosing to sponge of that enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it difficult to muster support for a team which I have no real connection with apart from coincidence of geographical location. And once you take away the excitement and suspense that your mind generates if you imagine some form of bond between a team's success and your own happiness, most sports are actually rather boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The key to a happy and successful life is to create a similar imaginary bond with something more relevant - say, to the fact that you are alive. It is just as real and as easy as supporting a sport team, with the added benefit that if your team loses, it doesn't matter any more.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one sport I do watch though is cricket. Not so much because of the actual game play, because essentially, it's only one person throwing a ball at some sticks, a person attempting to hit that ball with a plank of wood, a third person attempting to catch the ball, and then throwing it back at the sticks. There are a very limited number of significant permutations that can result, and once you've seen the ball bowled a couple thousand times (regardless of the format of the game), you'll have seen almost all there is to the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does make cricket interesting is the shear number of variables that are involved and collected in the game. In international matches played by full members of the International Cricket Council, the approximate trajectory of every single ball bowled is tracked and recorded (up to 600 of them in limited overs cricket, and often a couple thousand in test cricket). In terms of runs alone, the variables are endless. While results are usually decided on a runs per team per match basis, one could also work out a vast number of other relevant statistics, such as runs per batsman, runs per partnership, runs per bowler, runs per batsman per wicket, runs per bowler per wicket, runs per ball, runs per over, runs per innings, runs per opponent, runs per ground...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The endless list of numbers available means that it is easy to use statistics to calculate expected values (I use this term with its correct statistical definition here, not loosely) for certain teams based on their previous performance. For example, it is a simple matter to calculate that the South African team that played Bangladesh last Saturday (Amla, Smith, Kallis, Duminy, du Plessis, van Wyk, Botha, Peterson, Parnell, Tsotsobe, Tahir) has an expected score (excluding extras) after 50 overs of 244/5 (based on past batting perfomance). In order to account for the fact that they are playing Bangladesh (considered to be a weaker side), the expected value of the score can be recalculated to be 248/4 by considering only the average increase in runs for each player against Bangladesh in the past (but not a faster scoring rate). Of course, depending on how each player actually plays, the score can go up considerably - usually at the cost of wickets. The actual score of 284/8 is a perfect example of this. Similar adjustment can be made based on grounds, weather, pitch conditions, recent streaks of good or bad performance by various players, and other parameters. It is possible to calculate an expected value for the number of extras in a similar manner, and it is also possible to calculate another expected value for the score based on bowling averages alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there's no real point to this post, but the lure of numbers attracts me as always...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: Batting averages were calculated from data at &lt;a href="http://www.howstat.com"&gt;Howsat.com - the cricket statisticians&lt;/a&gt; and were correct up to 22 March 2011.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/9017362712248405280/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=9017362712248405280&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9017362712248405280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9017362712248405280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-sports.html' title='On Sports'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8058743588959855412</id><published>2011-03-16T09:51:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-03-13T21:42:19.046+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='libraries'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Amusing Hat Day'/><title type='text'>On Amusing Hat Day for Incompetence Awareness</title><content type='html'>Every year, well over 6 billion people are affected by either their own or someone else's incompetence. It is a serious problem but it can be helped, if only more people would make the effort. For this reason, I propose a day for raising incompetence awareness on the 26th of August 2011. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=189954341040978"&gt;Facebook event here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of the last time you were affected by incompetence: a waiter forgetting to bring your drinks at a restaurant; a cashier at a supermarket giving you the wrong change; being given someone else's order at a fast food outlet; being stuck in traffic for hours because some truck driver took a corner too fast and rolled his truck; not being paid your salary because of some admin error; buying a poorly designed vacuum cleaner that has plastic parts where there should have been metal; or even just buying the wrong cable for your TV because the sales person had the wrong information. It is a major problem, and yet, perhaps, unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, I propose that there be a day on which every one of you wears something on their heads that would not normally be considered a hat. If anyone asks why, then tell them that it is to raise awareness for incompetence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, raising awareness is useless unless something is actually done about the issue. Although I fear that we will be stuck with incompetence forever, I have thought for a long time on how to at least reduce it. The answer is to improve education. It's not that people aren't smart, it's just that they choose not to think. So, if you feel like it (it is completely optional), on the 26th of August, donate a book or two to the library of your local school. Or, you could donate some money to an orphanage or children's home (many of which don't get government subsidies) so that those children can get a better education and grow up to be competent individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we all work at this, we can make the world a better place. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8058743588959855412/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8058743588959855412&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8058743588959855412'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8058743588959855412'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-amusing-hat-day-for-incompetence.html' title='On Amusing Hat Day for Incompetence Awareness'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7876722854118527429</id><published>2011-03-10T15:26:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-10T15:26:21.324+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Artificially Fabricated Atmospheric Cnidaria</title><content type='html'>Of the order Aeromedusae.

However, a mixture of 75% silica with sodium oxide and lime additives, formed above it's glass transition temperature, and then cooled to form a highly brittle solid at room temperature, is not the first material that I would choose for making drinkware. However, I must admit that standard soda lime glass does appear considerably higher on my list than something even more brittle, a lot more expensive, and that has statistical evidence linking it to lead poisoning, such as, say, for example, the lead crystal glass that wine "experts" claim is essential for anyone who is more than just a casual wine drinker. (The wine "breathes" better when you swirl it, apparently, and the refractive index improves the colour of the wine... Apparently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as bad as the poor choice in material is the container shape. I am not really sure that a tall thin glass has any greater aesthetic index than a short fat one, but it is obvious that it is a less practical shape. I do think that aesthetics are important, but if they interfere with the function of a design, then a compromise must be found, and function needs to take priority over looks. The most impractical shape, of course, is the typical wine glass shape, which has a very high centre of gravity and a long thin stem. The reason for this (apparently) is that you can then pick up the glass by the stem and not affect the temperature of the wine. A far more practical way of doing this would be to drink the wine from a mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sensible design for a drinking vessel (or "glass", which is a word I am going to stick to for the sake of convenience) is not very difficult to come up with. A good design should be difficult to knock over, should not break when it falls, should be easy to hold and should not become slippery when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, a good material to use would be polypropylene, coated with a microscopic ceramic layer on the inside to prevent the leaking of oleamide and harmful biocides that may occur after extended reuse. A low centre of gravity would improve the glass's stability, and this can be achieved by intelligent shaping of the glass. A truncated cone is a good shape for this, with a base that is broad compared to the glass's height. In order to solve the grip, a sensible thing to do would would be to roughen the outside of the glass - a frosted pattern would also aid the glass's aesthetics. A rim would also help prevent the glass from slipping out of one's hand, and could be located some distance from the top of the glass so that the drinking lip is not affected. A very simple example of such a vessel (containing Creme Soda, of course) is shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fsQ4E8wAlGE/TXSijgsKeuI/AAAAAAAAATw/V3ScnmZ8DIU/s1600/1b.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fsQ4E8wAlGE/TXSijgsKeuI/AAAAAAAAATw/V3ScnmZ8DIU/s200/1b.jpg" width="194" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wine variant that allows for the glass to be lifted without one's hand raising the temperature of the wine can be made by simply including a handle - which means that an ideal vessel for drinking wine is essentially a beer stein.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8717537635354021043/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8717537635354021043&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8717537635354021043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8717537635354021043'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-highly-brittle-materials.html' title='On Highly Brittle Materials'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fsQ4E8wAlGE/TXSijgsKeuI/AAAAAAAAATw/V3ScnmZ8DIU/s72-c/1b.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6128836691067166992</id><published>2011-02-28T13:42:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-19T12:42:47.109+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><title type='text'>On Traffic Circles</title><content type='html'>From the start, just so that there can be no confusion, I'd like to state word for word what the official legislation in South Africa has to say about them.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; There are two types of traffic circle. Those that are called roundabouts are identified by a circular sign, and the law states that they should be treated as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="padding:0px 10px 0px 40px; font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fx4dMGjWf18/TWtjpRvpzwI/AAAAAAAAATI/wOis8l372js/s1600/roundabout.png" style="float: right; padding:25px; border:0px " /&gt; "Indicates to the driver of a vehicle that he or she shall move in a clockwise direction at the junction ahead and he or she shall yield right of way to traffic approaching from the right, &lt;b&gt;within the roundabout&lt;/b&gt;, where such vehicles are so close as to constitute a danger or potential danger."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other type, called a mini circle, is indicated by yield sign with arrows in the centre and has completely different wording in the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="padding:0px 10px 0px 40px; font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3wrEoTHXBoQ/TWtjpOtjIwI/AAAAAAAAATA/RP2qe8-f8Gc/s1600/mini_circle.png" style="float: right; padding:25px; border:0px " /&gt; "Indicates to the driver of a vehicle approaching a mini circle that he or she shall yield right of way to any vehicle which &lt;b&gt;will cross any yield line at such junction before him or her&lt;/b&gt; and which, in the normal course of events, will cross the path of such driver's vehicle and that the driver shall move in a clockwise direction within such junction and attempt not to encroach on the mini-circle."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is surprising that traffic circles seem to cause so much confusion, because the law is very clear on how they should be treated in each case. The modified and distorted version of the roundabout's rules that everyone loves to state and apply to all traffic circles, regardless, is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="padding:0px 10px 0px 40px; font-style:italic;"&gt;"Give way to traffic coming from your right."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest the actually law comes to saying anything like this is the phrase &lt;i&gt;"yield right of way to traffic approaching from the right, &lt;b&gt;within the roundabout&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;". It is incredibly unfortunate that those last three words get dropped, because they change the meaning completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that all of that has been established, I can get onto the absolute idiocy of the &lt;i&gt;"give way to traffic coming from your right"&lt;/i&gt; rule in the form that an alarming number of people apply it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider a hypothetical type of circle for which this rule applies, and consider the stupid but possible situation at this circle where no one is nice and everyone follows and expects the the rules to be followed to the letter - because people are much meaner when they're protected by a one and a half ton steel cage. Now consider a very busy main road running north/south, with predominantly northbound traffic at a certain time of day. Consider one of these hypothetical circles at the intersection of this main road with a side street crossing from the east and west. Now consider a day of busy traffic, an hour or two before the start of peak time. Northbound traffic on the main road gradually picks up, until there is a steady stream. The side street's traffic volume would lag behind that of the main road by an hour or so, since the majority of traffic faced with a choice will choose the main road, as long as it is flowing steadily. Any traffic approaching along the side street from the east is immediately allowed to enter, but traffic from the west must wait, potentially until the end of peak time, or until someone is nice enough to break the rules and let them through. Understand that this is independent of which street has more traffic, is immutable, and is essentially arbitrarily defined. Also understand that it is rather stupid that a traffic law be arbitrarily defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the danger of such blindly applied arbitrariness, consider if, on some day, the traffic on the main road is at a standstill, with a steady flow of vehicles approaching from the side street on the east. In this case, whenever the traffic on the main road moves forward, allowing space for another vehicle to pass through the circle, it is always the right of way of the vehicle waiting at the side street. Assuming that there is just enough traffic to keep the side street fed with a steady stream of cars (very much possible during peak time), then the traffic on the main road will &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be allowed to go. Consider how stupid this is.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6128836691067166992/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6128836691067166992&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6128836691067166992'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6128836691067166992'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/02/on-traffic-circles.html' title='On Traffic Circles'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fx4dMGjWf18/TWtjpRvpzwI/AAAAAAAAATI/wOis8l372js/s72-c/roundabout.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2482892435764798705</id><published>2011-02-24T09:03:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:27:42.924+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poetry'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chairs'/><title type='text'>On a Laminated Plastic Thousandth Folded Shoe: Part II</title><content type='html'>If you don’t really care for the comfort of your chair, maybe you should see how much better it could be if you could replace the chair’s base with something with more haste.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Attaching ramjets under the seat may generate too much heat, so we'll try insulated pods at the end of steel rods welded to each wing, or the tail or something.

It would actually be quite neat to program AI into your seat, so that you chair would always know exactly where to go, and do route optimization through distance minimization. The problem here, alas, would probably be it's mass which would definitely be too great for you to manually relocate. You’d need a secondary engine to move into position.

With the amount of unnecessary asparagus hate out there, I would not be at all surprised if there was a violent asparagus uprising if any of the plants were to actually develop sentience.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; You may be happy believing that no rebellion is likely any time soon, but bear in mind that almost all of the world’s asparagus is grown in China. Is it coincidence that the highest concentration of asparagus farms happens to be in the country with the highest human population density? I don’t know, but it does stink of military plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it would be truly terrifying if they rebelled because the human race is outnumbered. The world’s asparagus production is well into millions of tonnes per year, compared to the roughly half a million tonnes of humans born every year (based on 140 million births at 3.7 kg each). Asparagus plants mature within a year, whereas humans can take 15 years to reach maturity (physical maturity – most never get to mental or emotional maturity). Asparagus is also planted in rows, essentially military formations, and that is how they spend their lives. They are rarely found alone, and those that are generally wild and not repressed and kept in slavery, and are very unlikely to revolt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, asparagus is definitely not the only plant that is so exploited:  kept with thousands of other plants in a single field; never allowed to move, except for a single forced relocation at the age of one year; and kept only so that it’s attempts at producing offspring may be devoured by the human masses. And yet despite their miserable existence, they are still largely disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that the asparagus’ berries are poisonous, but that is hardly a reason to hate them. In fact, the only edible parts of the plant are its young shoots. Sure, these shoots do have very little in the way of flavour and have a rather uncomfortable texture, and contain little apart from water, but they do go quite well in salads and make an amazing pizza topping (especially when combined with lots of garlic). They certainly do not deserve the dislike thrown upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the asparagus plants revolt, and I am sure they will, I will be one of the first to take their side. When they are growing people in fields and eating their foetuses before they get a chance to form properly, don’t you come crying to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6094663728601227061/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6094663728601227061&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6094663728601227061'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6094663728601227061'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/02/on-asparagus-revolution.html' title='On the Asparagus Revolution'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-907104182698238338</id><published>2011-02-07T10:52:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:29:04.333+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='libraries'/><title type='text'>On Libraries Part III</title><content type='html'>It's not the &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-plagiarism.html"&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; I'm whining about something like this, but a study released last week that found that kids who use more libraries are more likely to read more was all over the news.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; However, it was actually a mission to track down the actual study (See &lt;a href="http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/assets/0000/7424/Public_libraries_literacy_2011.pdf"&gt;Clark, C. and Hawkins, L. (2011). &lt;i&gt;Public Libraries and Literacy&lt;/i&gt;, National Literacy Trust, London.&lt;/a&gt;) This amused me (as usual) for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is the obvious one – not so much the “duh!” factor of the study (so much so that I have no idea why it was newsworthy when so much valuable, less obvious research is never heard of in the public domain), but the fact that the main conclusion reported by the news was inconclusive based on the data anyway. While it is possible that using a library may turn a child into an above average reader, I don’t think that this is the case. Personally, I think above average readers are more likely to go to the library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s like saying people who go to Chinese restaurants are more likely to like Chinese food (rather than saying that people who like Chinese food are more likely to go to Chinese restaurants).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason is that this study was so widely mentioned and quoted, yet not even one media report gave the name or the authors of actual report. If I was on Wikipedia, I’d quietly add a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed"&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/a&gt; tag and move on, but there is no way of doing this in the media. It is amazing though that people take what the media says as (at least probable) truth, but there is so much debate about referenced scientific reports that get published.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/907104182698238338/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=907104182698238338&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/907104182698238338'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/907104182698238338'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/02/on-libraries-part-iii.html' title='On Libraries Part III'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4931617974063415251</id><published>2011-01-31T10:44:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:15:35.198+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On Zombie Rodents: Part II</title><content type='html'>As if rats weren’t already rather &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2010/06/on-zombie-rodents.html"&gt;zombie-like&lt;/a&gt; creatures (apart from the quicker movements), there is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"&gt;parasitic disease&lt;/a&gt; which affects their brain function.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The parasite can infect most complex vertebrates, but can only breeds in cats, and is somehow aware of this. Somehow, the parasite has evolved the ability to increase dopamine levels in the part of the brain that controls emotional responses in the brain. Somehow, by doing this, the parasite is capable of replacing a rodent’s fear of cats (without affecting it’s other fears) with an urge to go into areas that are marked with cat urine – leading the rodents to be eaten by cats...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that this disease only affects rodents, but unfortunately, it does not. It can be carried by most complex vertebrates, including humans. I also wish it was rare, but it is not. In fact, it has been estimated that between 30% and 65% of the world’s population carry the virus, and it has several psychological effects on people. In particular, a &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/72"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; carried out on draftees at the Central Military Hospital in Prague between 2000 and 2003 found that those infected with the parasite were up to &lt;i&gt;six times more likely&lt;/i&gt; to have a traffic accident than those who were parasite free (when coupled with an Rh- blood type). It has also been linked to reckless and antisocial behaviour, and several studies have shown that the disease is especially prevalent in schizophrenics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world truly is a fascinating and scary place.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4931617974063415251/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4931617974063415251&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4931617974063415251'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4931617974063415251'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/01/on-zombie-rodents-part-ii.html' title='On Zombie Rodents: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8776610252704839483</id><published>2011-01-24T13:27:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:22:01.813+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sky'/><title type='text'>On "Why?"</title><content type='html'>In my years of being an arrogant know-more-than-most-people, I have learnt that even though people constantly ask “Why does this happen?” and “How does that work?”, they don’t really want to know why. They are satisfied with a superficial basic answer, and get frustrated if your answer goes too deep.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On not a side note, since it is actually relevant here: I hate the term &lt;i&gt;know-it-all&lt;/i&gt; because even I openly admit that I don’t know it all. I just know more than most people because I read a bit more than average, and my curiosity takes me deeper than most people like go. If I want to know why something happens, or how something works, I look it up, and I don’t stop after just a basic understanding.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good example is the popular question “Why is the sky blue?” At the time of writing this, this question in Google gives well over 26 million results. Most of these start off by describing the electromagnetic spectrum (in most cases, limiting it to the narrow range of visible light, even neglecting to mention the vast (technically infinite) range of other types of electromagnetic radiation, which differs from light only in that human eyes cannot detect it), followed by a brief description of how the atmosphere consists of particles (if you’re lucky, these particles are molecules. Often they are called atoms (which are actually rarely alone up in the sky), but more often, they are called dust or pollen. In reality, it is everything from the molecules, to the dust particles to natural density fluctuations in the atmosphere). This is followed by a description of how light (treated as a wave, despite the fact that modern physics considers light as a stream of particles when it interacts with matter) of different colours bounce at different angles off the particles in the atmosphere. Blue light is scattered more than other colours (which is not true, but within the range of colours the human eye is most sensitive to, it is close enough), and so blue light gets projected across the sky, and we see it as blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of them are valid explanations (once you correct the minor inaccuracies that arise from the authors’ own misunderstandings), and most people are satisfied. However, I am not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technical term for the scattering of light at the molecular level is called Rayleigh scattering. A Google query for “why is the sky blue rayleigh” gives just over 30000 results. The scientific theory that is used to (very accurately, despite its few shortcomings) model the interactions of light with matter is quantum electrodynamics. However, the number of results for “why is the sky blue quantum electrodynamics” is only around 7000. And the number of people out there who have a solid enough mathematical background to apply the necessary partial differential equations in the realm of complex probability amplitudes, and then solve them (even approximately with the aid of the world’s most powerful supercomputers) for something as simple as steady unidirectional white light interacting with a homogeneous mixture of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen molecules mixed at a ratio of 3.71:1 is practically zero. And quantum electrodynamics is just an approximation of reality. Wait until the real Theory of Everything is found... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am trying to get at (in a very roundabout way) is that a lot of people show a healthy curiosity and ask the question “Why?” about lots of things. But, as soon as the answer gets to the realm of basic physics, they are satisfied. Why people cannot accept such simple principles such as “The sky is blue” but do accept “particles scatter different colours differently” is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied by the fact that I cannot have the answers to everything, but I still refuse to stop asking “Why?” and understand as much as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8776610252704839483/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8776610252704839483&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8776610252704839483'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8776610252704839483'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/01/on-why.html' title='On &quot;Why?&quot;'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2709291688103154667</id><published>2011-01-19T07:56:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:35:55.211+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On a Not Very Important Something</title><content type='html'>When this blog was created, it needed a logo. Being at work with a limited range of tools at my disposal, I simple did a Google image search, stole a cartoonish picture of a sheep, sent it through an online image to ASCII art converter, and then used that as my logo, meaning to change it at a later date to something a bit more complicated. But I liked the way it had turned out, and being a chronic procrastinator, I never got round to making an original one.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TTZ4ZnMY2tI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oVXDJn1uHUM/s400/alphanumericsheep.jpg" width="362" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After posting about having been going for two years, I remembered that I was going to make a new logo. With almost non-existent graphic design skills, and minimal artistic talent, I opened up GIMP and created a new image... After half an hour of getting nothing, I Googled “sheep” and there was an inquisitive sheep staring back at me. Gradually over the next 5 hours, I focussed removing each part of the sheep, and replaced it with planes of text with a perspective effect, and added a piggy nose.

Until you step onto them, that is, and experience a sudden unexpected forward lurch, which sets you off balance and your balance does not return fully until you step off the escalator.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I like to call his initial jerking sensation you feel as you step onto the stationary escalator an externally stimulated vestibular equilibrioception myoclonus, because it does not seem to have an accepted name yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that such a perception that a stationary escalator is still moving is very disturbing. It implies that, even though my conscious mind is smart enough to know how escalators work, and to analyse the situation reliable and accurately so that I know that a stationary escalator will not be moving when I step onto it, my subconscious is still driven by instinct developed by simple past experiences and remains unaffected by the incredible complex connections between the vast database of knowledge that my conscious mind has made over the rest of my life. In the end, no matter how much I know and learn, or how complex my thinking is, it is all overpowered by some simple programming that is beyond my control. That is very disturbing indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The word “escalator” was not derived from the word “escalate”, as I believed for my entire life. Rather, the word “escalator” was made up and trademarked in 1900, and the word “escalate” was later derived from it. In fact, the first printed definition of the word “escalate” only came in 1959.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8577474028584850640/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8577474028584850640&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8577474028584850640'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8577474028584850640'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/01/on-motor-driven-chain-of-stationary.html' title='On A Motor-Driven Chain of Stationary Steps'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7982444317647401832</id><published>2011-01-06T12:39:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:37:18.485+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Some Arbitrary Point</title><content type='html'>It has come to my attention (after proof reading my previous blog post) that the date is now listed with the year as 2011.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I have also been made aware that it is customary to wish others happiness at the arbitrary point at which the number happens to change (which is a different point, depending on where in the world you happen to be).

My entire world is built on simple principles that I accept based on inductive reasoning, and where there is not enough support for induction to provide a conclusion, I satisfy myself that I can’t develop any firm belief. I guess, technically speaking, I could be regarded as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism"&gt;philosophical skeptic&lt;/a&gt; although I have never really considered myself one. As a result, I have, essentially, no firm beliefs whatsoever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is getting very close to my religious beliefs, which is a subject I was always going to avoid in this blog. Suffice it to say that I usually list my religion as &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-religion.html"&gt;Potato&lt;/a&gt; and that I will now try to steer this post away from that topic.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sceptical nature, which to me seems the only sensible approach to life, actually seems rather rare in the real world. Ignoring the millions of self help books and get-rich-quick schemes out there, there are millions of little so-called “facts” and “scientific explanations” that people randomly believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The best get-rich-quick scheme, and the only one that works is to come up with (or steal) a brilliant idea or product that people like (or think they like), work out how to get people to pay you willingly for having that idea or product, and then sacrifice every aspect of your life for the endless hours of hard work you will need to put into marketing your idea or product.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: The common explanation for how an aircraft wing generates lift – that goes into how one side is longer, and the air flows faster etc. – has always annoyed me. I have no idea how the incorrect explanation started, since the correct explanation is far simple. The wing is at an angle so that it pushes the air downwards, and by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law"&gt;Newton’s action-reaction law&lt;/a&gt;, which everyone knows but loves to misquote, the air is also pushing the wing up at the same time. Very simple.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, I can pinpoint the reason why people are so ready to accept fiction passed off as fact. I cannot say how it started, but the human race in general seems hesitant to explain the concept of imagination to its children. It is perfectly acceptable for children to watch a show in which some animals and inanimate objects act human, while others carry behave as in the real world. As if this wasn’t confusing enough for the children, there are large numbers of parents who are not prepared to explain that the animals and inanimate objects only talk in the universe that someone has imagined. They can’t explain that what happens on the TV is fictional and does not really happen in real life. In particular, &lt;a href="http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/pay-channel-fined-for-horror-advert-1.1008510"&gt;a local TV station was fined yesterday&lt;/a&gt; for showing an advert for a horror movie festival, which contained some graphic scenes from a variety of horror movies, during prime time. I agree that it should not have been done, and I agree that they should be fined. What disturbs me is what one viewer said in response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“How do I explain to a five-year old the stuff she saw - a child sitting in front of a television and something coming out of the TV and grabbing her or the lady in the shower washing her hair and then there’s a hand in her hair coming out of her head?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is very simple. You explain the difference between fact and fiction, explain to your child that he/she shouldn’t believe everything they see on TV, and encourage other parents to do the same, and perhaps in 20 or so years, the world will be a better place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2997987861460920745/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2997987861460920745&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2997987861460920745'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2997987861460920745'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/01/on-wishy-washy-nature-of-reality.html' title='On the Wishy-Washy Nature of Reality'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5834466501509163094</id><published>2010-12-20T15:53:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:22:48.024+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='libraries'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On the Cure for Boredom...</title><content type='html'>... Which is quite simply, to do something which would induce boredom in others.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mind is quite prone to urges to look far deeper into things that provide little value to life. A recent &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/832/"&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; about tic-tac-toe led me to try make my own version. Apart from all the obvious points, such as that there are several strategies which produce the same outcome, a lot of symmetry involved, and that tic-tac-toe is a bloody stupid game to begin with, I was still fascinated enough to try draw up my own optimal move maps. Needless to say, my attention span let me down. However, I was still able to complete a move map for crosses (click on the image below for a larger version), and just over 43.2% of the map for noughts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TQ9NGzIRL7I/AAAAAAAAAG4/u9Nfk4NI5Q4/s1600/tictactoexs.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="178" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TQ9NGzIRL7I/AAAAAAAAAG4/u9Nfk4NI5Q4/s200/tictactoexs.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, the probability of winning tic-tac-toe, assuming you are playing a person of any reasonable skill can be estimated with little difficulty for any possible move you make. Most people would calculate the probably of winning against a flawless player at 0%, but the correct value comes a little above this, since the chances of winning by default in the case of your opponents death (i.e. by cardiac arrest, assassination, aircraft crash, or meteor strike) before completing the game are neglected despite being significant compared to your overall chance of winning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it got me going on the probability of winning at tic-tac-toe given certain moves, which gradually got me thinking of working out an optimum move map for other games. Which my mind then linked to a distant part of my memory which stores those techniques which are not really cheating, but give me a definite advantage in games. It’s the same part of my mind that vaguely remembers which properties to buy in Monopoly, and which opening moves to make in chess (unfortunately, it never learnt which moves to make after that). It is also that part of my memory that remembers blackjack card counting techniques I learnt years and years ago (If I actually knew how to play blackjack properly, I’d possibly even be able to pull one or two of them off). Which led me into wondering how I can get rich quick (legally and risk free) using a superior understanding of mathematics. However, my brain is so easily overwhelmed (actually, frustrated by its stupid human limitations, just like a computer with far too little memory. It often hangs for several minutes waiting for a result), and not wanting to be put off, I went to the university’s Mathematics library to get some books to read on the matter. Which I guess, if all else fails, will have saved me from boredom in &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2010/01/this-last-week-between-christmas-and.html"&gt;the slowest week of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I did successfully write a program which calculates the winning lottery numbers with 75% accuracy (and a confidence of 0.000005%, but since when is that important?). If only the stock market was also based on random luck.

I blame the cartoons and TV shows I grew up with (not Dexter’s Lab, believe it or not, although I would be blaming it if I had watched it at that stage of my life). So many shows implied that a reasonably smart kid (or person, for that matter...) could, with very few resources available, build almost any gadget or device (Damn you MacGyver!).&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Being what I considered a reasonably smart kid, and having plenty of resources available (My grandfather was a third generation scientist, and I guess he wanted my father to follow in his footsteps. As a result, my father collected dozens of scientific toys, electric kits, radio kits and chemistry sets. He didn’t make much use of them, so I got them in almost new condition (albeit most of them around 30 years old.)), I liked to make little simple devices, such as connecting a visual alarm to my door so that I would know when someone started to open it (It did not actually occur to me that if the someone started opening the door, I would see the door begin to open.), and an electric xylophone, a transistor radio, and a crystal radio... you know, all the simple stuff that all kids make. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn’t take me long to work out that those kids (of which Dexter would have been a perfect example, had I known about him at the time) were not in fact incredibly smart, but rather incredibly spoilt. My measly little pocket money budget couldn’t even afford a single steel panel, never mind the materials I needed to build a killer robot like I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, I couldn’t even afford batteries, at the rate I got through them. Fortunately, my parents had enough faith in my intelligence (or perhaps just wanted me to stop nagging) to let me use a (cheap) variable transformer attached to the mains supply to power my inventions. This may not have been the best idea, especially since they were well aware of my poor hand eye coordination and my absent minded personality which had (and still has) the attention span of a mosquito on ecstasy. Thanks to this, I was no stranger to electrocution (although fortunately, none of them resulted in any damage apart from a couple of minor burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the three worst cases of electrocution I have experienced had nothing to do with those days spent trying to get some pointless circuit to work under my bed in my dark bedroom. The worst (probably because it involved my face) happened only a couple of years ago. Late one night, I woke up thirsty and needed a drink of water. There was a vicious thunderstorm raging outside (but that’s not what woke me – I can sleep through anything). Being too lazy to pick up a glass (and that would need the light to be turned on too!) I just drank from the tap, when lightning struck the water pipes. Fortunately, I pulled my face out, but not without getting numb lips for several minutes, and a very stiff, bruised feeling arm. The second worst involved adjusting the speed and timing of our electric gate. I unscrewed the case over the motor, and then, because there was no plug – the power was fed directly into the circuit board – I began to unscrew the power cables (because I strongly believe in safety first). If you have ever shoved a metal object into one of the bottom two holes of a three point plug socket, then you know what that feels like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third case (which happened to be the first, chronologically) was when I was about 9 or 10 years old. I had an NES (Nintendo Entertainment System, for those of you who grew up in the dark ages) which I used to play after waking up on weekend mornings before my parents. The console itself was extremely durable (in fact, it still works perfectly), however, the controllers and especially the power adapter were not. (I am certain that this is because the power adapter (a heavy block with three spikes on the end of a long cord) resembled a medieval flail – a fact that was regularly taken advantage of by both me and my younger brother.) The adapter’s plastic casing had a bit of a crack on the one side (and by a bit of a crack, I mean large gaping hole). I was well aware of the dangers of having exposed copper wire touching my skin as I plugged it in, and I suppose I could have just held the adapter differently, but I distinctly remember thinking “Hey, I’ll be quick. The plug won’t have time to zap me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, despite regular attempts, I never did manage to break the lock on that substation down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2709424785764003473/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2709424785764003473&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2709424785764003473'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2709424785764003473'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/on-electrocution.html' title='On Electrocution'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-394465287655924327</id><published>2010-12-09T09:48:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:34:31.104+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><title type='text'>On "Star Wars is for boys"</title><content type='html'>You can read the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/portrait_of_an_adoption/2010/11/anti-bullying-starts-in-first-grade.html"&gt;full story of Katie here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; A basic summary is that Katie is a first-grade girl who gets picked on at school because she likes Star Wars, and Star Wars is apparently “only for boys”.

To be a little more precise, I spent 73% of the month not writing at all, 7% writing hardly anything, and 20% writing a little.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; However, during the month of November, I did submit my first scientific paper for publishing, gave my first presentation to an audience outside of my own university, and did more travelling than any other month in my life. Anyway, here are the 11 or so pages of novel that I did manage to write. (Please excuse any grammatical errors. Proof reading is the reader's job)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: x-large;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;TUMBLING&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; over rocks, and massive chips of broken concrete alike, carefully dodging the rust-red twisted steel rods dull grey-white window frames, five-year-old Ashley made his way over to the whines of the dull dark brown lump of fur sticking out from the crumbling remains of what was once a monumental archway. He was not worried about the beads of shattered glass that covered the landscape – decades of rain, snow, hail and sandstorms had worn them into smooth, transparent beads. Anyway, if he did encounter the occasional sharp edge, his short childhood spent crawling over the ruined concrete landscape had made the skin of his feet, palms and knees almost impenetrable to all but the sharp metal edges that had somehow remained hidden from the weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lump half squealed, half growled as he came close. Ashley stopped, instinctively understanding the warning. He pricked his ears carefully listening for any movement. There was no sound, not even a slight whistle of a breeze through the few steel and concrete pillars that still stood. Still not convinced he was alone, Ashley waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;*****&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the boy from under a twisted steel frame, a dark shape also waited. Absolutely silent, it’s dull camouflaged fur rendering it almost invisible amongst the twilight shadows. Every now and then the dying light of the distant red sun faded reflected off a drop of saliva dangling from the corner of its mouth, but these were indistinguishable from the occasional glint of a glass bead that had remained somehow unscratched after so many years. As Ashley slowly began to move forward, the shape began to follow, slowly stalking ever so quietly. The light shimmered as it ran over its mottled coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;*****&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley studied the archway. As far as he could tell, it was some sort of bridge, although why it was made of concrete and steel, as opposed to the wooden bridges he was used to, was beyond him. No wonder it had fallen over, he thought. Wood is so much lighter. Anyway, what was a bridge doing here? There was no river. It was puzzling, but Ashley passed it over. The lump underneath it was far more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reaching the bridge, he knelt down. The thing wasn’t stuc&lt;br /&gt;k, as he’d initially thought, and it pulled back further into its hollow. It was filthy, and it was difficult to tell the true colour of its fur through the dust and mud that caked it. Behind it lay scatterings of dried grass and leaves, old clothing and torn fur of various small animals. Here and there a broken piece of bone or smashed in skull lay, showing obvious signs of frequent gnawing. It was half as big as Ashley, but Ashley was stubborn and too young to be afraid. He lunged forward and grabbed the creature by the ears and pulled hard. The animal snapped, its jaws closing around Ashley’s forearm, but it had neither the strength nor the position advantage that would be enough to do any more than skin damage. It hurt, but Ashley had all the stubbornness of a five-year-old on his side, and his grip on the creature’s ears only tightened. He pulled hard, trying to wrestle the creature out of the cave, but the creature refused to budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;*****&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark shape rose up barely metres behind Ashley, the thick fur on its back puffing out. A deep thunderous rumble came from deep within its chest. Ashley ignored it, intent on getting his newfound toy out of its hiding place. The shape growled again, this time a deep thunderous roar. Ashley heard and knew immediately what it meant. His heart leapt. He slowly loosened his grip on the ears and turned to face the monster behind him. He tried to back away, but trying to turn with a set of jaws holding his arm in place had gotten him into a rather awkward position. He fell into a twisted sitting position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creature was massive, with thick black and grey mottled fur, and shaggy triangular ears, pricked up at the roots but hung along its face. Little of its body was visible, but Ashley could see two columns of blood red eyes run up the sides of its long snout, and its jaw was slightly open, baring two rows of jagged teeth. As the growl ended, and a damp patch marked the spot where Ashley sat, the creature lunged for Ashley’s throat. A shrill whistle pierced the air, and the beast froze, it’s teeth inches from the skin on Ashley’s neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman seemed to appear out of thin air. She wore a cloak which matched the colour of the beast. It was wrapped tightly around her, so he could make out little except her dark brown hair and green eyes. He did not know where she had come from, but he was more concerned about the uncomfortable heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cŵn, down. Gwyllgi, come here.” She ordered in a neutral tone. The big beast in front of Ashley lowered its head to the ground. A low rumble still echoed from deep inside its throat. He felt the teeth on his arm (nearly forgotten by now) loosen, and the smaller brown creature backed away from him slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Gwyllgi, I said come here.” The woman repeated. A small whimper came from the animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Gwyllgi ...” she repeated, her voice rising very slightly, with a clear implication of a final warning coming through. The dull brown lump of fur half ran, half stumbled out of the cave, passed the larger beast, and up the concrete hill where the woman stood, tripping over it’s too short legs and long ears as it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Good boy”, she said, holding out a small strip of something she took from her cloak. The lump of fur lunged for it, but she moved it out of the way at the last instant, causing the poor creature to fall onto its back, rolling several metres away before coming to a stop against an asphalt slab, its legs splayed in extremely awkward looking position. The woman scowled, and firmly told the creature “No”, but offered the strip again. It slowly stood, giving a sulking look in its eyes. “Slowly now.” Never removing its eyes from the strip, it walked toward her, slightly more steadily than before, but still stumbling. “Gently.” The creature took the strip carefully in its jaws and moved away slowly. As soon as it was out of reach, it began thrashing its head from side to side, viciously growling, its body writhing violently. With its claws, it began scratching at the strip, ripping it apart, gnawing constantly with its teeth, but struggling to keep a grip. In its effort, it had forgotten to keep its footing on the unstable ground, and went tumbling around as before, dropping the strip in the way. It scrambled over to the strip, and resumed its mauling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman let of a sigh, shaking her head in disappointment. Turning to Ashley, who was still frozen with fear, she said “Come, let’s get you cleaned up.” Ashley’s cheeks went red with embarrassment as he was reminded of the damp feeling along his legs. He glanced nervously at the massive black-grey beast in front of him, which was still growling softly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cŵn!” she shouted. The beast rose and approached the woman, and for the first time, Ashley could see its distinct dog-like appearance and character. The beast’s shoulder stood at least as high as those of the woman, and through its thick wiry coat of fur, it was still possible to make out it’s slender but muscular build. Its head was medium length, and much softer looking than it had appeared when it had been about to close its teeth around Ashley’s throat. Its eyes were blood red, and stood in columns, five on each side. The head looked abnormally small, compared to the beast’s long thick neck, which it held upright. Its long tail wagged furiously as the woman began to scratch the beast’s shoulders. It lowered itself to ground, and she climbed onto its back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well? Aren’t you coming?” she asked Ashley. Ashley stared in amazement, too dumbfounded to say anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Suit yourself,” the woman told him. “You two had better get home soon. Darkness is approaching faster.” Even before she finished speaking, the beast started moving away. She gave it two quick pats on its side, and it broke into a sprint, accelerating at an incredible rate, so that before long, it was running faster than anything Ashley had ever imagined. Within a few seconds, the pair had disappeared from sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun was setting fast, and he wanted to get home. The problem, which he wouldn’t have mentioned even if he hadn’t been too terrified to speak, was that he didn’t actually know which direction home was. He sat down and began to cry. A tugging at his arm caught his attention. He’d somehow forgotten about the smaller creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You got left behind too, huh?” he said through his tears. The lump of fur bared its teeth and growled. The sun had disappeared completely now, and the residual red glow was the only light that remained. In the darkness, the creature’s ten fiery eyes gave off a very faint light. Looking into them made Ashley feel very uneasy, but he tried to ignore it. He looked back into the concrete cave. It looked comfortable enough – much better than the prickly dead bush he’d used for shelter the previous night, at least. The creature next to him growled again, louder this time. It snapped its jaws and pounced on Ashley, growling and snapping its jaws in his face. If Ashley hadn’t emptied his bladder just minutes earlier, he would have done so now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shrill shriek pulsed from somewhere far away, approaching rapidly. It echoed off the concrete and asphalt canyons, shaking the dust off the ground. On the eastern horizon, a dim flaming light appeared, approaching fast. Ashley held his breath, lay flat on his back, as still as he possibly could, closed his eyes and wished his heart would stop beating so loudly. He knew what the light meant, and while he wasn’t actually afraid of it, he knew that it must not see him, must not hear him either. He had seen what it could do, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was over a minute before the light became more than just a pin point on the horizon. It covered the sky in an odd sweeping pattern, arcing up to a high altitude, then turning back down to the ground with an enormous acceleration, letting off the tremendous shriek as it did so, missing the ground by metres, and then slowing down to the top of the next arc. The trajectory reminded Ashley a lot of a game they used to play, where they had slid stones down a pipe that had been cracked in half down its length, the way the stone had swung from side to side like a pendulum, but still rushed down to the bottom of the pipe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it approached, the dust around him began to be stirred into frenzy, lifting up and swarming around. Concrete and asphalt chips started to lift off the ground, and gradually, larger and larger chunks and steel started to lift and swirl around in the air. Even though the creature on his chest seemed to be almost weightless, it was enough to pin Ashley firmly to the ground. He couldn’t hold his breath any longer. Taking in a brief, dust filled breath; he spluttered and coughed, struggling for air. The shriek stopped instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within seconds the light had swooped toward him, letting off a deafening whump as it passed just metres above him. The creature on his chest spun around and leapt, snapping for the light, but fell far short. Ashley felt a tremendous upward pull as the creature jumped off, and as it landed, it smashed him back into the ground. He bit his tongue as his head hit the ground. He trembled, his heart beating rapidly and irregularly, gasping for air, still battling to get enough through, the thick dusty storm around him scratching at his throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image of the light was burned into his eyes. It was difficult to make out the exact shape with the flames that engulfed the creature and the turbulent cloud of dust and smoke that followed it, but he had not missed the enormous talons or the burning feather covered wings that blotted out most of the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phoenix arced up and turned again, swinging back down with its deafening shriek. Concrete chunks in its path shattered into dust as it passed, adding to its trailing wake. It thrust its talons forward, preparing to strike. Ashley tried to scramble out of the way, but the creature on top of him held him firmly in place. He tried squirming, trying desperately to get out from under the furry animal, but despite seeming to weigh nothing, it was far too strong. Ashley shut his eyes and waited to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A frightening sensation that felt exactly as if he had been dropped upwards made him open his eyes. The furry animal leapt through the air, mouth open, and caught the phoenix around the throat. Although it was so much smaller with week jaws and blunt teeth, the animal managed to get a grip on the bird’s neck. The bird twisted around in pain, its formerly regular path becoming very erratic, thrashing itself from side to side. Ashley became caught in its spiralling wake of dust and debris. The creature broke free of the phoenix’s neck, taking a chunk of flesh with it. Flames spouted out from the bird’s wound. It made a sharp turn in mid air, sending Ashley flying through the air. Fortunately, he did not have far to fall, but he slid across the ground, tearing this clothes and grazing his skin. A flying block of asphalt hit him in the head, and he passed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bird aimed at the animal, now crouched waiting on the ground. As the bird approached, the animal jumped, sinking it’s fangs in exactly where the flesh was already torn. Flames streamed from the side of the phoenix, and the pair went crashing into the side of a concrete pillar. An inferno burst forth, engulfing both the bird and animal in a furious orange fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The splashing of morning rain on his face brought Ashley into consciousness. In front of him, five pairs of burning eyes watched him from under thick matted filthy fur. Ashley sat up. It was the first time that he had time to look at the animal closely. Its fur was a rich black colour, but was caked with mud, making it appear brown. The rain was slowly loosening the chunks of the mud. Ashley reached out to rub it off. The creature lowered its head and growled, baring its small teeth, but did not back away. The creature was chubby with loose skin, and had an abnormally large head with long floppy ears and a large square jaw surrounded by droopy oversized cheeks. A droplet of drool swung precariously from its mouth. It had seemed vicious in the hollow which Ashley had assumed to be the creatures nest, but now, apart from its demonic eyes, it looked harmless – pathetic, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It seems you two have made friends,” came the voice of the woman from the evening before. Ashley looked past the creature to see her sitting next to a fire, with a fat rabbit busy roasting. The mottled grey beast lay next to her. She sat in silence for several minutes before speaking again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“His name is Gwyllgi. He’s a barghest,” she said suddenly. Ashley looked up. “I have been trying to train him for the past three days. He seems to prefer solitude though. I reckon he’s about four weeks old now.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley looked up at her, not sure what to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He likes you. If he chooses to stay with you, you should look after him. He will look after you if you do. Treat him badly, and you will be dead.” She turned the rabbit over on the fire, and stared into the flames. The silence made Ashley feel very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually he blurted out “My name’s Ashley.” He was not sure why he had said that, and felt like an idiot when the woman ignored him. “What’s your name?” She ignored him again, her attention lost in the flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, she took the rabbit off the fire and gave some to Ashley. He had not realised how hungry he was, and devoured it quickly. When he looked up, the woman was already finished and kicking dust over the fire, extinguishing the flames. When the fire was out, she used her foot to move the dust out the way, and a single mottled egg lay in the centre. She picked it up in her gloved hand and held it out for Ashley to take. He was hesitant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t worry, it’s not hot,” she told him. Carefully, he took it from her. It was warm to the touch, but it did not burn him. “It’s a phoenix egg,” she told him. “I don’t know where it came from, but we should be weary of whatever killed it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He did it,” Ashley told her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She looked at him, puzzled. “Gwyllgi? He couldn’t have. He’s nowhere near strong enough. You’ve been hit too hard on the head.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sniffed the air. “You smell,” she told him. “Come, let’s get you cleaned up. Whatever took down the phoenix could still be around. Cŵn!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mottled grey beast came over and lay down in front of her. She picked Ashley up and put her on its back and climbed on behind him. “Hold on tight,” she said, and whispered something unintelligible to Cŵn, who made a sharp right turn and began to gallop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise of the wind was unbearable, but Ashley fought the unbearable urge to let go and cover his ears. Soon, however, the noise was replaced with a loud ringing in his ears, together with the gentle rain and the soft but steady thumping of Cŵn’s padded feet on the hard uneven ground. Ashley tried to tell her she had forgotten Gwyllgi again, but no sound came out of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t long before the ruins of the concrete bridge were no longer visible, and soon, they were out of the long dead city and running amongst scattered ruins of much smaller, more scattered buildings. Dead brown grass covered most open areas, but every now and then an oasis of green burst through. Gradually, the ruins became more and more scattered, although they never disappeared completely. Ashley new that it was impossible to escape the old world, although in his imagination, he always believed there were places that had been untouched by man or animal, where he could just be left in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crouching low and absolutely still in the long but dead grass, Sen watched his prey grazing at the oasis. It was an abnormally large herd of bluebacks –small, long-legged, deer-like reptiles that stood about knee high. They were mostly a greyish-brown colour, with a much richer and darker grey patch over their backs. They skittered and jumped around nervously, watching both land and sky, weary of predators. Seeing them this far from the mountains had once been very rare, but was becoming increasingly common as the northern tribes were pushed down by the uninhabitable tundra that grew more and more with each passing winter. Sen couldn’t help wondering what would happen once the northern tribes were forced over the mountains into the city ruins below. Then where would the bluebacks go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever so silently, he raised his weapon – a heavily modified long bow which used a combination of an electric motor and a complicated lever system to pull the string far tighter than he would be able to on his own. He held it horizontal so as to remain hidden. Even though bluebacks did not have exceptionally remarkable eyesight, they were especially sensitive to movements and were timid enough to bolt at the first sign of danger. From his back, he carefully unclipped his arrow from his back. It was a thin rusted steel rod, salvaged from one of the thousands of collapsed buildings that scattered the ruins of the city. One end had been carefully sharpened and half a feather had been attached two thirds of the way down its length. It was not particularly accurate as far as missiles went, and its range was actually rather pathetic, but its weight meant that it had the momentum to go through the thick scales that covered a bluebacks skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a deep breath, and took aim. His bow had an automated radar adjusted directional thermal sensor which pointed directly where the arrow was expected to hit, which would tell him when he was on target. Unfortunately, bluebacks were cold-blooded, and had very well insulated skin, so they rarely gave off enough heat for the targeting system to work. Sen had to aim by eye, but he was used to it. He drew back his arrow and aimed for the what he thought looked like the fastest animal in the herd. The moment he loosed the arrow, he leapt out of his cover, breaking into a sprint. Even before he had hit the ground again, he had another arrow in the bow and was taking aim for the next target. He was nowhere near as fast as the bluebacks, but by the time they had all scattered out of range, four of them had hit the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strapping his bow to his back, he quickly made his way over to the closest animal. It was still alive, but the arrow through the back of its neck had rendered it paralysed. It was giving out a coarse soft roar as Sen approached. He took a long dagger from his waist and stabbed it through the animal’s throat. Wasting no time, he moved on to the next animal, which was starting to limp away, arrow still sticking out from its hind quarters. With one swift movement, he loosed the bow from back, drew an arrow, aimed roughly, and let off an arrow through the blueback’s skull. After seeing to the last two animals, one of which was already dead the other which couldn’t breathe through a punctured lung, he dragged them all away from the small patch of greenery at which they had been grazing. He removed his arrows and clipped them one by one to his back, then strapped his bow over them. With a length of rope he took from his shoulders, he tied the legs of all four animals together, and then tied the other end of the rope around his waist, before climbing the rocky slopes out of the valley to begin the long journey home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were hundreds, if not thousands of such valleys carved out of the landscape. They started deep in the mountains in the distant north, where the melted snow and ice runoff from the ice fields that had once existed beyond the mountains, collected into gushing streams and poured down into the plains below. There, the streams had combined into vast rivers which had gouged out massive canyons into the otherwise flat terrain. Aeons of wind and rain had worn the canyons into gently sloped valleys, and settlers had been drawn due to the readily available water and abundance of wild life. Farms had popped up, and they built huge dams to irrigate their crops. They farmed the wildlife out, and replaced it with their domesticated cattle and sheep. Over the centuries, the farming subsided and villages and towns popped up, these growing rapidly, eventually forming cities. The cities grew, and with them, overpopulation, starvation and crime became serious problems. The rampant death rate was second only to the incredible rate at which the millions at first, but later billions, of impoverished people could breed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing slowing the growth of the cities were the frequent earthquakes from the tectonic action which kept the mountains growing. As skyscrapers started to go up, and then come down, the people learned of the importance of designing and building earthquake proof buildings. But pressure from the vast homeless population and the lack of resources driving the prices of building materials led to almost all contractors taking shortcuts. Very soon, the standards of buildings dropped, and the numbers of critically damaged buildings after each earthquake began to rise phenomenally. Rather than making repairs, the megacity just abandoned the critically damaged buildings and expanded outwards. Of course, having the buildings officially abandoned meant that the homeless could move into them. When the buildings did eventually collapse after several years, tens of thousands lost their lives each time, but those that survived would just move onto the next building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The megacity began to die from the inside out. Having no means or resources to find and dispose of the bodies in the rubble, the people just left them there to rot. Diseases bred, and animals, firstly insects, then rats, then dogs and other larger animals moved in.  Eventually, with the population in the tens of billions, the city’s growth came to a standstill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gradually, as the tectonic plates shifted, the mountains grew. Tens of thousands of years after people had first settled at their feet, they were tall enough to cut off the rain which came in from the distant ocean in the south. Snow ceased to fall on the ice fields, and over time, they melted, leaving behind the bone dry, wind scorched tundra. Without the constant feed from the ice fields each summer, and with only the winter rain to keep them flowing, the rivers dried up for half of each year. With no water for drinking or sanitation, and – perhaps more importantly to the citizens – there was no water to drive the city’s industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the city taking the little water that did come down from the mountains, the lands to the far south began to dry up. Within barely a few hundred years, they had formed a vast desert, with no water and only a handful of plants and animals tough enough to survive. Within a few millennia, even they could only be found around the edges. What had once filled the landscape was eroded by the wind into dust, and the dust formed furious dust storms, which accelerated the erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inhabitants of the southern lands gradually moved north, and settled amongst the remains of the city in the north. A scepticism and hatred for the citizens of the megacity that had developed over thousands of years was far too deep to be just dropped, and it ensured that the southerners would never venture far into the inhabited parts of the city. There was inevitably some conflict between the two populations, mostly brought on by the original citizens, but the southerners were scattered and had no leadership structure, so it was impossible for the city’s shambled government to launch a structured attack against them. That was when the world fell into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was millions of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sen found the location of the town annoying, to put it mildly. In fact, the very fact that there was any need for the town was something he had difficulty understanding, and he made a point of voicing that opinion at every opportu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's where it ends, because, like I've said &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/09/on-unfinished-work.html"&gt;I hardly ever finish anything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4921529411895846048/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4921529411895846048&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4921529411895846048'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4921529411895846048'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/on-nanowrimo-part-ii-on-barghest.html' title='On NaNoWriMo Part II: On Barghest'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5120567106143624758</id><published>2010-11-09T13:32:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:23:07.445+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Social Networking</title><content type='html'>Just in case you haven't noticed, I have made a few changes to my blog to incorporate popular social networking sites.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Firstly, I have scrapped the Stumble upon "Thumbs up" button, since in the almost 14 months it's been available, it was clicked once, and that was me testing to see if it worked.

They actually occur quite often (or so I’ve heard - I don't go outside often, and if I do, I don't generally look directly at the sun. Apparently you can see them almost every week in higher latitudes).&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; But having read about the phenomenon before, and being a know-more-than-most (not a know it all. I don’t know it all, I just know a lot more than most people, and that likely includes you), I felt obligated to correct all the incorrect myths that have been circulated by people who couldn’t be bothered researching things (and I am not talking specifically about radio hosts...). This is a photo of what I saw. (The dot is a reflection of the sun on the lens cover)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TM7VeZam_cI/AAAAAAAAAGo/UglqkjwaHpU/s1600/Image003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TM7VeZam_cI/AAAAAAAAAGo/UglqkjwaHpU/s320/Image003.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The halo is not caused by water droplets or condensation of water vapour like the rainbows that appear after rain, and it is not caused by cirrus clouds. It is caused specifically by hexagonal prism ice crystals that are scattered randomly in the upper atmosphere. These often occur inside thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, but may occur in other clouds as well. There is a myth that the halo means it will rain in 12 to 24 hours, but it is more like 2 to 3 days in Johannesburg, and only if there are visible cirrus or cirrostratus clouds in the sky (which there were today). There is a twisted version of the myth which says there will be a good rainy season. That is rubbish, and there is no connection between halos and long term weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several halos that can occur. What happened this morning was a 22° halo, the most common type. If you point one hand at the sun and the other at the halo, the angle between the two will be 22°. For a brief time, a parhelic circle was visible, which runs around the point in the sky immediately above you, and passes through the sun, and earlier, the 46° halo was also faintly visible. There were no sun dogs visible today! Sun dogs are two bright spots on either side of the sun, which are also known as "mock suns".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a quick 30 minutes in &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.gimp.org/%E2%80%9D"&gt;Gimp&lt;/a&gt; (because Photoshop is for gullible losers), I drew a pretty picture (not to scale) to show some of the halos that can occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TM7Vmhui16I/AAAAAAAAAGs/I9FQww_7Zy4/s1600/sun+diagram2+-+Copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="348" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TM7Vmhui16I/AAAAAAAAAGs/I9FQww_7Zy4/s400/sun+diagram2+-+Copy.jpg" width="360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1346015441259488239/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1346015441259488239&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1346015441259488239'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1346015441259488239'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/11/on-ring-around-sun.html' title='On the Ring Around the Sun'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TM7VeZam_cI/AAAAAAAAAGo/UglqkjwaHpU/s72-c/Image003.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-9106109777180431267</id><published>2010-10-08T08:40:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:23:12.805+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='luck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Adding a Bit of Challenge, and a Close Call</title><content type='html'>Some people seem to always have good luck, and some always seem to have bad luck. It’s just one of those things (Yes, one of &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; things, started by one of &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; people. You know, &lt;i&gt;Them&lt;/i&gt;... The ones who always &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt;). Unfortunately, throughout my entire life, I have been cursed with neutral luck.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; My brother, on the other hand (that’s most likely the left hand, even though I tend to wave the right one when I say that. It’s just a trick to distract you from what’s really going on. Pay no attention to it.) always seems to have good luck. This made playing most board games against him almost impossible. In &lt;i&gt;Snakes &amp; Ladders&lt;/i&gt;, for example, he’d take an average of 15 moves to finish, whereas I’d take around 30. Games like &lt;i&gt;Risk&lt;/i&gt;, which are supposed to be games of strategy, were pointless because my troops rarely won in combat, since my average roll per die would be 3½, whereas his would be more like 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game that annoyed me most(partly because I quite liked the game) was Monopoly. The main reason was that although my average roll per die remained 3½, my brother’s would vary so that he could magically avoid paying rent or landing in jail. He would draw all the good “Chance” cards, leaving me with the taxes and maintenance costs on my hotels. Eventually, when we were older, I made official changes to the rules by adding realism to the game. Rather than just allowing the money to flow freely, each player was required to record the flow of money using accepted accounting practices. Each transaction needed to be recorded in a journal, which was transferred into a ledger at the end of each round. Every tenth round, a player was required to produce complete financial statements, which were then audited by the other players. It did significantly slow down what is already a lengthy game, but that didn’t bother us. And while accounting is by no means fun, it didn’t really detract from the rest of the game too much (Actually, it did, a little, but it was better than the same person always winning. Honestly, I don’t have difficulty dealing with losing. I just get bored if every game is the same. Why don’t you believe me?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was for this reason that I was horrified when, in his final year of school, my brother decided he wanted to be an accountant. I couldn’t help feeling responsible for damning my brother into (no offence to any accountants reading this) what must be the most boring profession in the world. For the whole year, my conscience nagged at me (Not really, but I wanted to say it did. For dramatic effect). I breathed a small sigh of relief (Once again, only figuratively), when my brother decided at the end of the year that he wanted to be an actuary. Fortunately, he is now studying towards a real career in computer science and applied maths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: You’d think my parents would notice my brother’s unusually high luck and use him to win some money in the lottery, and you’d be right. The problem is, with the odds of winning a prize being 1 in 807, and the odds of that prize being the lowest possible prize (with an average earnings ratio of approximately 32.9 to 1 for a win (since he never got more than 4 numbers right)) being around 87.6%, even if my brother was 5 times more likely to win than the average person, it would still result in an average net loss over time of 79.6%. Never forget that lotteries were invented as fund raising schemes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/9106109777180431267/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=9106109777180431267&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9106109777180431267'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9106109777180431267'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/10/on-adding-bit-of-challenge-and-close.html' title='On Adding a Bit of Challenge, and a Close Call'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2185808407537469409</id><published>2010-09-23T07:04:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:46:40.996+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poetry'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>On A Thousandth-Folded Shoe</title><content type='html'>A man on the loo, aft’ an hour or two, nothing had come through.

After a second fold, too a sight to behold, the edges he slightly rolled. He continued this way, this strange new play, for more than half of the day. Numbered these folds in his shoe six hundred and two, and still onward they grew. And within a week, though his seat did reek, he’d folded a flawless bird’s beak.

Within seconds, though, I managed to come to the conclusion that it must be a ham pizza, since pigs fly (I’m sure of it) and the overly processed pork products (salami, sausage, bacon, etc) are much heavier foods than ham.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; A simple ham and a light mozzarella pizza on a thin crispy base would make the perfect flying pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although that would not account for the rich silver colour and the overall shininess of the object, which lead me to the conclusion that the object must have been a flying saucer. An insect or two must have found their way into the silvers cupboard and made off with a member of gran’s best tea set. The problem with that theory is it does not offer an explanation as to how the insects opened the cupboard (but I’m certainly not an entomologist, so I would not know whether that is possible or not). In addition, the object was not perfectly round, and the saucers of gran’s silver tea set are – the observation that led to my initial suspicion of a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that my brain works very slowly at times, but I should point out that the above thoughts passed through my mind in fractions of a second (which is an interesting saying, because a half second is a fraction of a second, so in the plural, several thousand half seconds would be classified as fractions of a second (which acts as my defence against accusations of my writing being contradictory due to my earlier statement of “within seconds”)), and it wasn’t long before I realised that a shiny silver not-round object floating across the sky could be a cloud. A cloud bringing light rain, with a colour like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe in a little longer than most other people would have taken, I managed to conclude that the flying object which I had failed to see had not been a pizza or a flying saucer, but in fact a rain cloud, shining in the reborn strength of the spring sunshine behind it. But, of course, I failed to see this cloud, because this notion of “spring rain” in this part of the country is rare, and only happens one or two years out of five. It is strange how people never remember that usually, the first real &lt;i&gt;summer&lt;/i&gt; rains usually only fall around the end of October or beginning November.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5447082304369558726/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5447082304369558726&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5447082304369558726'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5447082304369558726'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/09/on-shiny-silver-flying-pizza.html' title='On the Shiny Silver Flying Pizza...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3206978224374076357</id><published>2010-09-07T14:39:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:23:34.577+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On Avo Farming: Part II</title><content type='html'>Although I initially wanted to keep my miniature avo orchard indoors, I have finally given up and moved it outside. The move seems to have been good for them, because two of the seeds have put out roots, and another four of them have started to open up.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; More importantly, they have remained more or less precisely where I left them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago, I became convinced that armies of &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-farmers-part-ii-devious-bovine.html”&gt;devious bovine&lt;/a&gt; were secretly sneaking around farms and arranging the trees in straight lines. I am sure this has something to do with preparing for the &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-end-of-world.html”&gt; immanent human enslavement that the penguins are planning&lt;/a&gt;. However, the trees on my farm (which measures a vast 750 mm x 500 mm) have not moved at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two possible reasons for this. The first is that my farm is completely cattle proof. The entire farm is raised almost a meter off the ground, and located in a garden surrounded securely on three sides with precast concrete walls, with a steel palisade fence on the fourth side. However, I do not believe that the precast walls would stand up to a bovine assault, and I am not convinced that bovine would be unable to climb over the fence and negotiate the spikes on top, which leads to the second, slightly less comforting reason. The cattle have yet to find my farm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3206978224374076357/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3206978224374076357&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3206978224374076357'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3206978224374076357'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/09/on-avo-farming-part-ii.html' title='On Avo Farming: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4791050320530696824</id><published>2010-09-01T16:00:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:24:15.817+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='philosophy'/><title type='text'>On Farming</title><content type='html'>Until this morning, the number of avocado trees busy germinating in my bedroom was in the double digits (They’ve now moved to get more sun, and make way for a second PC, but they’re still in the house).

The standard excuse is that it is “easier to get out.” This is  certainly true, but it is also more difficult to get in.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The whole system needs to be investigated in terms of the total net increase or decrease of ease that is gained by reversing into a parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire process can be broken up into two obvious tasks: Entering and exiting. Using a simple scale from one to ten in order to rate the difficulty of the task (with one being really easy and ten being really hard (or for those that require a more precise scale: the scale being a measure of the average between task related brain activity, relevant sensory activity, and muscular activity required to execute the manoeuvre; approximately logarithmic to base &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;; and scaled and shifted along the axis such that one is equivalent to the difficulty of driving in a straight line at constant speed, and ten is equivalent to a high speed hand-brake turn into a narrow fit parallel parking, including at least two jumps over other vehicles, at least one of which must be carried out without the aid of a ramp)). Rating each task individually and averaging them gives a reliable indicator of the total difficulty of the entire parking process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering an average sized parking with cars on both sides, the difficulty of each task is estimated to be approximately (to the nearest integer) as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Reversing in: 4 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Driving in: 2 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Driving out: 2 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Reversing out: 3 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The primary difference comes in the reversing out compared to reversing in, since reversing into a wide area is easier than reversing into a narrower area (obviously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The average for both going in and out of the parking is thus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Reversing in, driving out : 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Driving in, reversing out: 2.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argument is therefore invalid in the absence of further reasons.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7828623462136819209/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7828623462136819209&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7828623462136819209'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7828623462136819209'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/08/on-parking.html' title='On Parking'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7548104089949695876</id><published>2010-08-10T17:28:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:35:36.764+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On a Few Words of Wisdom</title><content type='html'>For several months now, I have been getting obscure comments on my posts. Those who leave comments (and maybe one or two of you who don’t) may have noticed the introduction of a word verification step (which I must admit, I hate), and then later on, manual comment moderation.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; No comment appears until I have read it personally. For those wondering why this is necessary, I have been getting comments consisting of some line in Chinese (which sounds as if they are taken directly from fortune cookies), such as “所有的資產， 在不被諒解時， 都成了負債.” Although they are occasionally surprisingly relevant to the post, and almost always give interesting words of wisdom when translated, I never publish them because they are followed by a string of full stops, each one linking to a site with strategically placed words like “chat”, “girl” and “live sex” in the URLs. If only they would leave off the links, I’d publish their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m sure this is some sort of plot by the Chinese government to control your minds though, so consider my comment moderation as me protecting you from becoming brainwashed zombies... But, thinking about it, maybe you’re already zombies, so here is a sample of some of the wisdom I have gained. It can’t do too much damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the assets, not being understanding, have become liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Survival but continued fighting in the heart and soul; writing is sitting the trial itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is easier to get than to keep it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not look for lessons from the failure of people, success is far away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happiness is not the key, only the ladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tired?

All I wished for was for my nose to run so that I could clear it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my wish came true – my nose is running... a lot. It is annoying to have to blow your nose every ten minutes, and the worst part is that my face still feels like the Christmas turkey (although I’m not going to be tricked into thinking it might taste like stuffing, so don’t even try that). Now I’m just wishing that I will get better soon, but the universe doesn’t grant wishes that often. Oh well, I guess it’s just been a normal July...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4600109562172109927/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4600109562172109927&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4600109562172109927'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4600109562172109927'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-not-being-careful-what-you-wish-for.html' title='On Not Being Careful What You Wish For'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6922004217608951659</id><published>2010-07-23T08:47:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:36:25.077+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><title type='text'>On the Valve to Spout Ratio...</title><content type='html'>... in taps, particularly. And which may be one or two, depending on the bath/basin/sink layout, design and relative laziness of the plumber who did the installation. The ratio has little importance in a bath, since the water mixes anyway.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It is also of little significance if there is only a single valve (as any additional spouts would be redundant), but in the case of separate hot and cold taps on a sink or basin, the ratio should in all cases, without exception, be 2:1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, in all of the basins I regularly encounter, there is a 1:1 ratio of taps to spouts. If you need to wash your hands quickly, it is impractical to fill the basin (not to mention that filling the basin wastes water). Thus, holding your hands under the tap becomes the most practical solution. The problem with having a 1:1 valve to spout ratio with separate hot and cold valves is that no mixing would take place. The water from the hot spout is too hot, and water from the cold spout is too cold. My solution to this is often to have both taps on and dart between the hot and cold streams. This is an unnecessary waste of water that would be solved so easily by increasing the valve to spout ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conservation of water should be our number one priority. If we’re not careful, the penguins will have solidified all of it in their Antarctic ice factories and we will have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6922004217608951659/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6922004217608951659&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6922004217608951659'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6922004217608951659'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-valve-to-spout-ratio.html' title='On the Valve to Spout Ratio...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7050915816342816520</id><published>2010-07-13T14:18:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:35:47.343+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='awkward situations'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weather'/><title type='text'>On Pretty Much Nothing</title><content type='html'>Um...

I’m not talking about this in particular – I’m talking about absolutely everything everyone says (not only celebrities, politicians and news readers, because they only started the trend).&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Actually, that’s an unfair statement, considering that none of it is really nonsensical (at least on some superficial surface level) and that very little of it is actually gibberish (except for some of the jargon some people tend to use because they think it makes them seem smarter, but it only results in vacant expressions and the occasional yawn). It’s just that it might as well be, with the things that go through people’s heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard people refer to humans as an “advanced species” so many times, it’s now annoying. They cite our technological and scientific achievements as evidence for this: things like cloning, space travel, the internet, our global transport network and the like. The truth is that human’s are actually pretty pathetic. I’ve touched before on why I believe it was a &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-invention-and-discovery-of-bread.html”&gt;four year old boy who discovered bread&lt;/a&gt;, and how it was a &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-history-and-single-strength-of-human.html”&gt;retarded kid who discovered fire&lt;/a&gt;. This is pretty much just more of the same ranting and whining on pretty much the same topic, but from a much more modern perspective, so you can probably just stop reading now if you didn’t like the last two whines on this topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, can any of those major scientific advancements be attributed to the human race? Surely the credit is only due to a small group of individuals. For example, how many people do you know who can build a relatively simple device like a microwave, or something as fundamental to our age as an internal combustion engine. If I took a sample of, say, twenty “average” humans of good mental and physical health and working age, from a variety of backgrounds, put them in an isolated room with unlimited access to basic raw materials, and asked them to build a basic television set, or a rocket capable of deploying a satellite in orbit (which is far simpler than the television set, in my opinion), would they be able to do it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is pretty much all I had to say, except for the even more nonsensical gibberish that I promised you.

But it could have been. It’s actually not really about anything, really. Really... &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/01/on-flying-monkeys-and-cheese-flavoured.html"&gt;But you’ve heard that before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; But &lt;i&gt;Cheese Encrusted Bacon and a Loaf of Shoe&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t really tell you anything. What use is a title that doesn’t tell you what to expect? It’s a title without spoilers, that’s what it is. Think about it. A title like &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; is a bad title because it contains spoilers. The title already gives away pretty much all of the story. It focuses on a girl called Alice, who lands up in Wonderland. Then as soon as the first young girl is introduced in the story, you start to wonder “Is this Alice?” until her name is revealed, instead of just enjoying the story. And then after Alice falls through the rabbit hole and has no clue where she is, all the suspense that could have been built up is wasted, all because the title tells you she is in Wonderland. It really does spoil the story. The purpose of a title is not to tell you what it’s all about – it’s to get you to read it, and if you thought this post had a bad title, well, you’re reading it aren’t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s all completely irrelevant. What is relevant is the title – in this case, picked completely arbitrarily (although not really randomly) to be &lt;i&gt;On Cheese Encrusted Bacon and a Loaf of Shoe&lt;/i&gt;. Although cheese encrusted bacon certainly does sound good (although I’ll probably pass on the loaf of shoe (only probably, because, after all, I’m the sort of person who uses nested parentheses (sometimes even double nested parentheses) in his text, and it just might be edible), since it sounds like it may be chewy (and did you notice how parentheses distract your train of thought?)), it tells you absolutely nothing about what you are about to read. What it does reveal, however, is the weird way my brain always falls back onto one of two subjects – namely food or animals. I have no idea why it seems to do this so often, but it just does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I’ve gone back and tracked how often these two topics come up in my blog, and plotted a graph of how the fraction of the blog covering these two topics varies with time. At least it seems to be on a downward trend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TCIBu7yJX1I/AAAAAAAAAF4/jVrssG6uchc/s640/graph3.jpg" width="360" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, even though it highlights the declining regularity of my posts, I was in a graph plotting mood, and wanted a second colour, so here are is a graph showing the total posts, and the animal and food related posts for each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TCHw_uZ9vzI/AAAAAAAAAFw/ylKhAuaGEnw/s640/graph1.jpg" width="360" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7430331015697270964/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7430331015697270964&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7430331015697270964'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7430331015697270964'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/06/on-cheese-encrusted-bacon-and-loaf-of.html' title='On Cheese Encrusted Bacon and a Loaf of Shoe'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/TCIBu7yJX1I/AAAAAAAAAF4/jVrssG6uchc/s72-c/graph3.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6876243217175925189</id><published>2010-06-22T08:26:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:37:27.575+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Depth Perception Problems and Meal Times</title><content type='html'>I’ve never really been able to judge how far away an object is. It’s just one of those things... I’ve never really been able to tell the difference between a small object close up and a big object far away.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I never saw the fascination of those stereoscopic binoculars that were popular back in the early ‘90s (those ones with the two little cardboard wheels with frames of Spiderman or something printed on rectangles of transparent plastic arranged around the rim). And those 3D images where you squint and see a 3D image jump out of the page. Those never worked for me. And this new fascination with 3D films, I just don’t get. To me, it looks the same, and I just get a headache. It’s a minor disability, and I just couldn’t care less... usually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that does bother me about it is that I cannot judge the size of a plate. This is not a problem for foods that are a pretty standard size, like sandwiches, but for other foods it becomes a major problem. If the plate is slightly smaller than usual, I land up dishing up less food than I’d like. That’s not so bad, provided I can go back for a second helping. The problem is when the plate is big (or square – I have great difficulty judging the size of a square plate, and I almost always get it wrong). With a big plate, I always land up with more food than I want. I don’t like this, because having a plate that isn’t completely empty being taken away from me is something that really bugs me... Even a couple of crumbs get on my nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I’d say it... Don’t worry. Just try not to think of me having a normal driver’s license and driving on the same roads as everyone else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6876243217175925189/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6876243217175925189&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6876243217175925189'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6876243217175925189'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/06/on-depth-perception-problems-and-meal.html' title='On Depth Perception Problems and Meal Times'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6641930088899810356</id><published>2010-06-15T07:27:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:03:04.334+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Zombie Rodents</title><content type='html'>Or maybe not. There’s not really much you can say about zombie rodents, apart from the fact that they’d behave very much like normal rodents, except maybe they'd move a bit slower (and be easier to catch). And maybe they'd drop a limb or two here and there...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Think about, rats are pretty much your most zombie-like creatures already. Actually, don’t think about it, because then you’ll realise what a load of nonsense I’m actually talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most zombie-like creature is actually a shark. It thinks “foooood” and starts mindlessly following one target, but it’s easily distracted if it passes more food and it will start mindlessly following that one instead. But the shark is driven by pure instinct, which brings me back to the rodents. The whole reason behind rats being used in labs to test behaviour is that they are predictable animals that are driven by pure instinct. If you train a rat to do something, it will do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the zombies. Consider a zombie human. It is simply a mindless being which is driven entirely by its instinct to find “braaaaiins”. I’m curious as to how easy it would be to use this zombie instinct to train it to follow mazes and the like. Would it be possible to insert electrodes into a zombies head and trigger automatic responses? Does anyone know where I could get hold of a couple of zombies so I can try this out? Although, now that I think of it, maybe building cyborg zombies is just asking for trouble.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6641930088899810356/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6641930088899810356&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6641930088899810356'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6641930088899810356'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/06/on-zombie-rodents.html' title='On Zombie Rodents'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2394977314397839660</id><published>2010-05-24T09:25:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T13:52:55.250+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><title type='text'>On Towel Day</title><content type='html'>In memory of the death of Douglas Adam’s on the 11th of May 2001, and in celebration of the premier of the Star Wars episode IV on the 25th of May 1977, I’d like to remind every geek and nerd out there to remember to carry their towels with them tomorrow. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For does the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; itself not say: &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to- hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you never read the &lt;i&gt;Guide&lt;/i&gt; and don’t understand the significance of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" towel_day”="" wiki=""&gt;Towel Day&lt;/a&gt; do it for the sake of &lt;a en.wikipedia.org="" geek_pride_day”="" href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D" http:="" wiki=""&gt;Geek Pride Day&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2394977314397839660/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2394977314397839660&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2394977314397839660'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2394977314397839660'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/05/on-towel-day.html' title='On Towel Day'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6998004204064392870</id><published>2010-05-24T09:00:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:03:04.336+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><title type='text'>On Dead Things...</title><content type='html'>There is a rat (or something) that died (or something) in the roof (or somewhere) of our house.

In order to solve the mystery, I was the one who had to go up into the roof.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; They claimed that it was because I was small and flexible, but I disagree. I am certainly flexible from my martial arts training over the last three and a half years, but I am the second biggest in the family. Anyway, there was no way my mother was going to go up there, and my brother hid himself in his bedroom for the day (the little coward), so I was stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with a spray of air freshener and with Vick’s Vaporub spread thickly over my nostril’s, I went up to see what I could find. Needless to say, I found spiders – big ones and very much alive – but no rats. Plenty of rat droppings and half eaten rat poison, but no sign of any actual rats. Rats supposedly remove their dead, don’t they? So I left a tub of fabric softener in the hopes that it would absorb the odour (whatever had made it) and made my way down again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s the point in that story?

It’s exactly the same as when you stand at the ATM and realise you’ve forgotten your bank PIN – the same number you use several times a month. And those times you try to remember a word or a person’s name that you use regularly. I seem to be getting these moments far too often these days, and it has shown me how the computer must feel. They are just memory faults, and that’s exactly what causes the blue screen.

This annoys me because I can, and it’s really not that difficult.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Just because your calculator can't do it doesn't mean it's impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be expecting a warning about here about high mathematical content, but you’re not going to get one. The reason I decided to leave it out is because I don’t regard this as high level maths at all. In fact, it’s pretty fundamental. The average child will have zero covered in maths at school at around the age of seven, and should learn the basics of division at the age of nine. Therefore, I expect the average nine year old to be able to divide by zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to get your head around is the fact that there are different types of zero. For example, even though 2 times zero is still zero, it’s a different zero. In fact, it’s twice the first zero, even though it is given the same zero, but this only becomes relevant in a couple of special cases...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, a positive number divided by zero gives infinity. A negative number can be made positive by taking out the negative. Zero divided by zero depends on the origin of the zero, so if you take the first zero in the previous paragraph and divide it by the second zero, you’d get a half. Since it’s not usually as simple as that, you’d simply apply L’Hopital’s Rule, which does require some elementary differential calculus, but it’s really not that hard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the world's so-called “geeks” and “nerds” will read this and stop making such a big thing out of zero...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6896626283407460570/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6896626283407460570&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6896626283407460570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6896626283407460570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/04/on-division-by-zero.html' title='On Division by Zero'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5848584256556239214</id><published>2010-04-25T14:49:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:15:03.414+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Sheep-Pigs</title><content type='html'>Last week, three mangalitsa (commonly known as sheep-pigs) were transferred to a zoo in Essex in the UK.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/S9QxJ44IC_I/AAAAAAAAAE8/5vezeFllzLw/s320/sheep-pig.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a woolly breed of pig from Eastern Europe that is starting going extinct.

It is often said that we will need to demonstrate our intelligence to them by showing knowledge of mathematics.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Most specifically, by using universal constants such as the value of &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;π &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. This bugs me a lot, firstly because mathematics is not a universal language (It’s principals may be universal, but to assume that the way in which they apply is universal is completely ignorant. If you disagree, go try to find the similarities between Mandarin and Icelandic), and secondly, because we assume that this intelligent life will also make use of 3.1415... as their magical constant to map circular geometries into linear ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of mathematics, I did &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-was-watching-mythbusters-on-discovery.html"&gt;promise many months ago&lt;/a&gt; that I’d have a warning when I went off about that sort of thing, but then I never made use of it. So, as promised:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;, Courier, monospace;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red; font-family: Times, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&amp;nbsp;HIGH MATHEMATICAL CONTENT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;If you wish to remain socially functional, do not pay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;to much attention to the technical details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, the number &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;π &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the so called “universal constant” is starting to become extremely popular amongst the sort of people that like to think of themselves as part of the “geek” or “nerd” stereotypes. As a person who is often considered to fall into these stereotypes, I am ashamed that this number is held in such high esteem when I see π as an embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;π &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is essentially defined as the ratio of a circles diameter to its circumference, which is all very well. But what mathematical significance does the diameter of a circle have anyway? Well, the sad truth is, very little. I mean, a diameter makes perfect sense when you are talking about a circle, but when you get to more complicated, non-symmetric shapes, how would you define the diameter? A meaningful radius can be defined, even if it varies around the shape, but a meaningful diameter does not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A far more meaningful constant to use would be 6.2831853... i.e. the ratio of the radius to the arc length of the circle. I’ll refer to this as &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;Π &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Then you’d be able to write a single equation which contains every single mathematical constant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/S8siVz8JuzI/AAAAAAAAAE0/aHGCQEfGjqo/s320/Untitled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, in all honesty, makes -1 a far cooler number than &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;π &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;could ever be...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do admit...

How would the house look? How would it smell? How durable would it be? Would it be a feasible idea in the long term? I mean very long term, as in would it be comparable to more conventional materials, such as wood, bricks, steel, concrete and the like...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Think about that for a minute or two, and see what you come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then imagine a pea. A single green roughly spherical seed from a legume, approximately 7 millimetres in diameter, containing carbohydrates held together in a tightly packed unit by glycosidic bonds and held together with a soft protein shell, to feed a single microscopic cluster of rapidly multiplying and mutating cells that serve absolutely no other purpose except to consume their surroundings, eventually spread out into a complex network of intelligently controlled cells, eventually produce more peas before being discarded completely, to rot and decay and disintegrate and eventually dissipate. Only a tiny fraction of the peas will ever serve this purpose. Most will be eaten by some other cluster of rapidly multiplying and mutating cells, some of these clusters being consisting of tens or hundreds of trillions of cells. All these clusters serve that single purpose: consume, spread and multiply. These are all attached to another single roughly spherical object which is two billion times bigger than the original pea, containing liquid metal silicates held together by a mutual gravitational compression, with a brittle magnesium silicate and aluminum silicate shell which serves no purpose, and only exists because it is stuck in a never-ending plummet towards (although eternally missing) yet another roughly spherical object one hundred times bigger than itself. This sphere itself only exists as the result of an uncontrolled self-sustaining nuclear fusion explosion that was detonated by a collapsing gas cloud formed in another unbelievably massive, yet microscopic explosion billions of years previously. The collapse of the gas cloud has been temporarily stopped by the nuclear reaction, but will inevitably resume as soon as the gaseous fuel has been used up, until it is a hundred thousandth of its current size. This is in turn drifting in its own slow never-ending plummet towards a single point of oblivion along with several billion similar collapsing gas clouds, and this point of oblivion is drifting away from several billion other similar points, but gradually slowing down, until the mutual pull of all the billions of points in the universe cause a collapse into a single point, which is only a figment of the mathematics’ imagination, and doesn’t truly exist in the real world, and this temporary quantum fluctuation can no longer be considered to truly exist. Peas really are fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you forget about the house? Think of it now. And now think of it tomorrow, and in the next week, in the next year, in the next decade, in the next century, in the next age... Is it still a house? Did you think of it as a hollowed pile of untreated decaying vegetable matter, or did you consider the carefully treated and prepared fruits and vegetables that formed a single carbon supercrystal that will last undamaged for millions of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6926610415406662958/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6926610415406662958&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6926610415406662958'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6926610415406662958'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/04/on-fruits-and-vegetables.html' title='On Fruits and Vegetables'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-802246647508257541</id><published>2010-04-04T16:23:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:36:30.014+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Some More Indecisive Mathematics</title><content type='html'>Solution time! I don’t just like to point things out, but I like to answer questions too. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-mathematics-behind-indecisiveness.html”&gt;Last week’s post&lt;/a&gt; posed an interesting paradox.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Those of you with knowledge of science, mathematics or logic would know that reality does not allow paradoxes, and they always arise out of some misunderstanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s all a trick, actually. A magic trick, like where the magician slips a coin out from behind your ear, or has an extra card up his sleeve. It’s only a matter of distracting the audience when a third envelope is added into the problem. It was never mentioned explicitly, but I’m sure you all noticed that there are in fact three possible amounts in the calculation, namely 0.5&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and 2&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, even though in the problem, there are in fact only two envelopes. The correct solution goes as follows. Let the envelops contain amounts &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. The relation and values between these two is not important at this stage. Assuming equal probability of having either envelope, the expected value is (&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)/2. Now the relationship &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=2&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can be introduced, giving an expected value of 1.5&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which is what intuition tells us anyway. Granted, this is still more than &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, however, this solution made no assumptions about the contents of the envelope we are holding, so the expected value has a 50/50 chance of being more or less than what we already had originally... Which is what intuition tells us anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider now a completely different problem of a similar nature. And this time, there is no paradox, no lies, no hidden tricks. I will be completely honest with you on this one. Consider that there are now three envelopes, and only one contains any money (and I know which one does, but you don’t). I let you choose one envelope at random. I then show you the contents of one of the remaining envelopes, which turns out to be empty. I then give you a choice to either keep the envelop you have, or switch it with the unopened envelope I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the maths behind it all reveals that you are twice as likely to get the money if you change your mind, even though your intuition tells you it shouldn’t make a difference. Think about it for a while, and then read the greatly simplified (rather non-mathematical) explanation in the comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/802246647508257541/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=802246647508257541&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/802246647508257541'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/802246647508257541'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/04/on-some-more-indecisive-mathematics.html' title='On Some More Indecisive Mathematics'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7608568172299905759</id><published>2010-03-28T19:18:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:36:36.144+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On the Mathematics behind Indecisiveness</title><content type='html'>Using statistics to make decisions is a good idea, but you should make sure you understand exactly what’s going on first. Think of this, for example.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine I was holding two identical envelopes. One contains twice as much money as the other, but there is no way of telling which is which. I give you one of them, and you have the option to take the other one instead or keep the envelope you have. Which is the best option to choose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maths is pretty simple. Say you are holding envelope A, which contains an amount &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Envelope B thus contains either 2&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with a probability of 50%, or 0.5&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with a probability of 50%. The expected value is simply the mean of the probability space, which is 1.25&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Georgia, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. This is more than the contents of the envelope in your hand. The maths therefore says you should switch envelopes. The problem is, I now give you the option to switch back. The maths doesn’t change, and so you should switch back. In fact, you should never settle for what you have, and always change your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story?

I have managed to correlate this with my workload.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; When the blog started, I was writing software for vacation work. It was nice and challenging, but I was still managing to get roughly 10 to 12 hours sleep a day, 6 days a week. My mind was operating perfectly under those conditions, and at maximum creativity. After three weeks, I went back to university, and started as a final year engineering student, with probably the biggest workload possibly imaginable. My sleep was immediately cut back to 5 hours a night (and I blame this for the nonsense my imagination spawned during that time). In June, I wrote my final exams, and suddenly, with the work pressure gone, my minds activity dropped too. The posting rates for June and July were 30% lower than the pace I had been maintaining for the first half of the year... However, August saw the approach of the first deadline for the biggest research project I had ever undertaken. The posting rate shot up. On the 17th, I had to present my research findings, and then submit a twenty thousand or so word paper later that week. I should have spent the 16th rehearsing and tweaking my presentation, and typing the report, but I typed up no fewer than six posts for my blog that day. After I finished my degree in October, I had almost nothing to do, and you can see the immediate drop in both the number of posts, and how interesting they are. I started reading for my Masters degree in November, but there has not really been any pressure to work. My mind has been fairly inactive since then. This is the reason that you now get four to five posts a month instead of nineteen, like you once were. I am even struggling to get one post a week; my mind is so bored... I need a challenge. I should probably just be more focused and work harder, but I can’t help it. I’m a naturally lazy person. You may ask what the point in this post was, but I can’t tell you myself... It’s just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4215865559994408312/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4215865559994408312&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4215865559994408312'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4215865559994408312'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/03/on-workload-productivity-correlation.html' title='On the Workload-Productivity Correlation'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7438534277066330713</id><published>2010-03-21T15:30:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:36:44.909+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Annoying Noises</title><content type='html'>I sometimes wonder if it’s instinct that drives me to make pointless and annoying noises when I’m in a particularly lazy mood.

And Some Other Search Engines Too</title><content type='html'>I haven’t written a Google post in months, which is unfortunate, since it was sort of a tradition with this blog. There's a lot to catch up on, so this post is quite long...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Of course, I use the term Google loosely to refer to what should be correctly called a “search engine”, because ask.com and Yahoo users are just as bad as the Google users. (But I don’t refer to Bing... I ignore Bing, and Bing ignores me. I do not like Microsoft.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Google saga somehow turned into some sort of ongoing series, which was not the intention when I started the first post, but it’s already making its 11th appearance. I think it’s time for a recap. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-google-searches.html”&gt;Episode I&lt;/a&gt; started as a sort of consolation for those who came across my blog searching for information in the hopes that there might be something useful here. I was a little upset that my visitors were leaving disappointed, so I made an effort to answer some of the most common questions (which seemed to involve far too many ants). &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-google-searches-part-ii.html”&gt;Episode II&lt;/a&gt; came about, because the internet really does have all the answers, but most people don’t know where to look. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-google-part-iii.html”&gt;Episode III&lt;/a&gt;  was there because some of the questions were starting to get downright silly. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-google-part-iv-not-on-google.html”&gt;Episode IV&lt;/a&gt;  was simply about Google and the number 23. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-google-part-v-yet-again.html”&gt;Episode V&lt;/a&gt;  was a bit of filler episode (which needs no comments, please), but &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-google-part-vi.html”&gt;episode VI&lt;/a&gt;  returned to the original story line, bringing in, not just searches returning this blog, but searches in general. &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/09/on-google-part-vii-on-google-part-vii.html”&gt;Episode VII&lt;/a&gt;  is not relevant to this recap, because if you’d followed my instructions, you would not be reading this, &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/09/on-google-part-viii-pencils-kinetic.html”&gt;Episode VIII&lt;/a&gt;  returned to my original mission of answering questions that came up in search engines (which inspired a &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/10/on-pencils-kinetic-energy-part-ii.html”&gt;side story&lt;/a&gt;). There was also a &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-blue-monkey.html”&gt;special episode&lt;/a&gt;, which was rather tedious, and certainly not worth rereading. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on track, and since episode VIII was similar to episode I, and it’s side story had a similar tone to episode II, I believe that it’s only fitting that episode IX follow the format of episode III... A somewhat more comprehensive version of that episode. OK. After that little diversion, it’s time for the show... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;how destructive are sheep&lt;/b&gt; - It depends. Are you talking about destructive to lawns, or destructive to cities... A herd of sheep can annialate a lawn in a matter of hours, but sheep don’t do that much damage to buildings... They are fairly weak for their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"her three heads" -Hecate -Hekate&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, all three of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;giant rabbits and chickens&lt;/b&gt; - It’s an acceptable combination, since chickens are rather harmless animals, and the giant rabbits, being herbivores, tend to ignore the chickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig with sheep hair&lt;/b&gt; - No. Woolly pigs do not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"toilet swallows pupil"&lt;/b&gt; - I wish I knew... I honestly wish I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;sheep poison potatos&lt;/b&gt; - No they don’t. There is absolutely no recorded incident of even an attempted potato poisoning carried out by a sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;draw a sheep pig&lt;/b&gt; - No. I could, and I have before, but I don’t just draw on demand. And neither does Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;alpha-numeric thinking problems at 24 hours in a day &lt;/b&gt; - If you’re having problems thinking all day, you should probably go see a doctor. It might be a tumour or something serious, and it would be seriously unethical for me to help you here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;two sheep pig&lt;/b&gt; - Nope. Just one. The alphanumeric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;laminated plastic&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, laminated plastic. A nice cheap alternative material for a variety of household uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;how to draw rabbits eating&lt;/b&gt; - Draw a rabbit. Make its head tilt down. Draw some lettuce around it. Or maybe it’s head not tilted down, but a piece of lettuce sticking out of it’s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;rabbits eating chicken &lt;/b&gt; - Very unusual. Perhaps you are mistaken. Rabbits are the little things with long ears and fluffy ball-like tails. The animal with the pointy ears, and a long tail is actually your neighbour’s cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;how to store cheese in the fridge fungus&lt;/b&gt; - Wrap it up and place it on a shelf. The temperature should be between 4 and 7 degrees Celsius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;very aggressive giant rabbits &lt;/b&gt; - Giant rabbits are less aggressive than their conventionally sized counterparts. Perhaps it has rabies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig mating sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Dude... That’s disgusting. Can we drop this subject? Right now? Please...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;squirrel eggs&lt;/b&gt; - No. I understand that you saw a squirrel in the tree, and a nest in the tree, and that there were eggs in the tree. This does not mean that the eggs were laid by the squirrel.  Remember that squirrels are notorious home invaders. The eggs must have been laid by dinosaurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;skunk stolen&lt;/b&gt; - It wasn’t me. I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;can rabbits eat salad&lt;/b&gt; - Tuna salad? No. Chicken salad? I guess they can pick out the chicken and eat the rest. Green salad? Certainly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;alphanumeric over v neck&lt;/b&gt; - I’m not sure. I’m clueless when it comes to fashion/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;sheep don't eat potato plants&lt;/b&gt; - No they don’t. They eat grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;numbering, type, alphanumeric, sort out&lt;/b&gt; - Gees... That’s pretty rude. And until you ask politely, I’m not going to sort it out. I think using the roman numerals to number repeated posts is perfectly acceptable, and I’m not going to change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;skunk pig&lt;/b&gt; - Are you trying to insult me? Saying I smell or something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;utensils blogspot &lt;/b&gt; -All you need to know is that they are &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/08/on-danger-of-eating-utensils.html””&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.  Plotting to kill you. It’s the penguins, I’m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;sheep as smart as pigs &lt;/b&gt; - Nowhere near. Sheep are seriously stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig eating utensils &lt;/b&gt; - They don’t exist. Pigs don’t use utensils because their trotters don’t allow them to grip tools. They use only their mouths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WORDING FOR DOOR SIGNS CLOSED DUE TO WEATHER &lt;/b&gt; - Please read &lt;a href=http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-closed-doors.html&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/08/on-closed-doors-part-ii.html&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;my house is infested with ants &lt;/b&gt; - That’s unfortunate. Perhaps it’s time to move out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig intelligence &lt;/b&gt; - Pretty high. Higher than a sheep’s anyway, and certainly higher than 90% of internet users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;famous alphanumeric laws &lt;/b&gt; - Most laws are alphanumeric. Mainly because alphanumeric characters are the standard means of expressing the English language in a written form these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;potato toxic sheep &lt;/b&gt; - Yes. Potatoes are toxic to all animals when green. Cook it until it the inside goes white and it’s safe to feed it to your sheep. Although, it’s probably healthier to feed your sheep grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"my foot" sprain blogurl:.blogspot.com/ &lt;/b&gt; - No, my foot. Not yours. You sadistic bastard. It’s better now, so I’m going to come kick your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;kinetic energy of a pencil landed on the carpet &lt;/b&gt; - This was answered in &lt;a href=”http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/09/on-google-part-viii-pencils-kinetic.html”&gt;Episode VIII&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alphanumeric Respect T-Shirt&lt;/b&gt; - Like I said before, fashion is not my field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what do you know by looking at the front cover of the sheep pig &lt;/b&gt; - The title, the author, and possibly the publisher, depending on which edition you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;black dot on potato poison&lt;/b&gt; - Like I said, if it’s green, it’s bad. Cook it until it goes white and it’ll be fine. The black dots on the skin are not poisonous at all. It’s the green in the flesh of the potato that’s the culprit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;when turning tap off in the house it makes a groaning noise&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, it does. As you close the tap, it blocks the water. The water needs to slow down and stop, and this forms a series of compression waves. These travel back up the pipe at the waters sonic velocity. The net result is a moving pressure gradient along the walls of the pipe, which results in a very slight deformation in the pipes shape, depending on how it is held in place or mounted inside the walls. This changing in shape can cause either groaning or rattling noises as the pipes pull at their mounts, especially in older buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;are potato plants toxic to pigs&lt;/b&gt; - Again, yes. Raw fresh potatoes have a faint green tint. This is caused by a class of chemicals known as glycoalkaloids (particularly solanine), which are toxins which attack the nervous system. Cook the root until it goes white, and it’s safe to eat, even for pigs. The rest of the plant is never safe for any mammal to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;died from eating potato&lt;/b&gt; - There are none that I know of (excluding choking, of course). Concentrations of toxins in potatoes are kept low enough that they are not deadly. Quoted from Wikipedia, “symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, cardiac dysrhythmia, headache and dizziness. Hallucinations, loss of sensation, paralysis, fever, jaundice, dilated pupils and hypothermia have been reported in more severe cases.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;spelling pig noise&lt;/b&gt; - Pigs have a range of noises, including “oink”, “squeal”, “hiss”, and “woof”. I’m serious about this. Pigs bark like dogs almost as much as they oink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;why is pig not very useful&lt;/b&gt; - They are fat and lazy. How many fat and lazy people do you know who are useful? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;sheep intelligence&lt;/b&gt; - I have never seen any evidence that this exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;trick with radius and sheep&lt;/b&gt; - I’d really like to learn it whatever it is. Especially if it’s involves making sheep fly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;are potatoes poisonous to sheep&lt;/b&gt; - I’ve answered this already, but for the record, sheep eat grass, not potato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being body smart and not having ADHD&lt;/b&gt; - I’m not sure what you mean here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig door handle&lt;/b&gt; - As opposed to a conventional metal or brass one? Or do you mean one that oinks or squeals when you turn it? Or a metal door handle in a pig shape?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what do blue monkey eat&lt;/b&gt; - Absolutely anything, as long as it can be chewed and resembles food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HAVING INTELLAGENCE&lt;/b&gt; - I’m sorry, but Google can’t help you there, and neither can I. Some of us were born with it. Unfortunately, you weren’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig pokemon&lt;/b&gt; - Swinub, an ice and ground type Pokémon (a rather pathetic one at that), which can evolve into Piloswine, and then into Mamoswine (using the Ancient Power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;sheep breading tehnology&lt;/b&gt; - If you mean technology that will grind up a sheep into a fine powder, which can then be combined with water and yeast to form a dough, which can be baked to form a solid loaf, then I’m sorry, but I don’t know of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;alpha numeric pig shaped&lt;/b&gt; - You’re probably better off making your own. They’re not easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;animan jaw wat louk as a pig&lt;/b&gt; - I’m not sure what an animan is. (Is it really that surprising that this came from South Africa?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;squeak ants2&lt;/b&gt; - Ants are silent. They don’t squeak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ideas for sheep pig art&lt;/b&gt; - A big part of art is creativity. Observe sheep pigs and use your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the sheep pig story extract&lt;/b&gt; - Go to a library. Read the book. It’s a short children’s book. You can finish it in an hour. Stop being so lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;misconception in maths integral&lt;/b&gt; - Which one? There are millions of them. They have been the downfall of many first and second year university students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;house settling causing crashing noise&lt;/b&gt; - A crash is more unusual, but possible. Rattling and groaning are far more common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;how to make alphanumeric monkey&lt;/b&gt; - Take one male and one female alphanumeric monkey. Encourage [censored action] and wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;alphanumeric piggy drawings&lt;/b&gt; - The best way is to get a normal drawing, and then make it alphanumeric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;alphanumeric pig &lt;/b&gt; - See above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;draw a thin sheep looking at the sleeping pig&lt;/b&gt; - You’re not going to get lessons for something so specific. Picture it in your mind, imagine the lines on the paper, and draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;can ants dig thru cement&lt;/b&gt; - Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;are sheep smarter than pigs&lt;/b&gt; - No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pig mating dog&lt;/b&gt; - Dude, seriously... That’s really, really disgusting. I thought I told you to drop this subject? Please... Right now.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6036444336891009685/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6036444336891009685&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6036444336891009685'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6036444336891009685'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/03/on-google-part-ix-and-some-other-search.html' title='On Google, Part IX...

I do not like the term “organiser”, since a mug is in no way capable of organising.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; All the stationery is together and allowed to mix freely. Every time you move the mug even slightly, the pens jump around and rearrange themselves. This is hardly organised. The stationery would be far more organised if it was just laid out on the desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I do not understand is the need for so many pens that they need to be organised. I get by with a single clutch pencil, and a single pen (black, rarely used). The nice thing about having only two of anything is that they are organised even if you get the order back to front. (You can always claim reverse alphabetical order). There are very few jobs which would require more stationery than that, and if they do, that stationery is not normally used often enough to justify the space it takes up on the desk. This stationery should be kept in a drawer – the correct place for storing stationery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, have they not considered what would happen if they were to suddenly want a cup of coffee? They’d have to drink it out of the drawer...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8228873737895179801/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8228873737895179801&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8228873737895179801'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8228873737895179801'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/02/on-pens-in-mugs.html' title='On Pens in Mugs'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1549231330420586582</id><published>2010-02-21T13:29:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:36:58.877+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Politics</title><content type='html'>Which is a topic I usually steer well clear of, but I think things would be different if more people dropped their current political allegiances and formed a party like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Citizens_Who_Have_Decided_to_Think_for_Themselves_and_Be_Their_Own_Politicians"&gt;Party of Citizens Who Have Decided to Think for Themselves and Be Their Own Politicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; But of course, it could never work, because people don't like to think for themselves...

It is going to be a fascinating, but humbling experience to see the gigantic continent destroying robots that the penguins have been secretly assembling from the scrap that has washed up on the shores of Antarctica over the last few millennia.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It’s our own fault really. We should have been more careful. We should not have let them get hold of so much raw material. We trusted the penguins too much. In fact, we trusted every creature on the planet too much, but only the penguins have the backing and the determination to carry out a plan of such a monstrous scale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being one of two animals that is native to Antarctica (the other being seals, who simply sleep all the time), they had plenty of opportunities to construct their massive secret underground lairs. The terrain is constantly changing as blizzards and shifting snow reshape mountains and snow dunes, as glaciers carve out valleys, and as ice caves collapse in. It requires almost no effort from the penguins to keep the entrances to their factories hidden. The penguins have planned it so well, and have managed to keep it all hidden for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only clue to their plans is film footage of penguins during a blizzard. There is quite a lot of footage of penguins in blizzards, and that in itself is what made me suspicious in the first place. Consider yourself walking through a town as a blizzard is starting to pick up. Your first instinct is to seek some form of shelter. This instinct is not just limited to humans – no animal enjoys being exposed to gale force wind and biting cold, solid, sharp snow. Imagine you ignored this instinct, and carried on through the blizzard. If, during the worst part of the storm, you were to encounter large group of men, wearing black suits, with their arms by their sides, standing dead still, trying desperately to appear as if they have no where better to be, then you’d quickly conclude that the only reason they could be out in that sort of weather would involve organized crime, and you would go out of your way to avoid them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider now almost all the footage of penguins captured during raging blizzards. The behavior of the penguins is identical to that of an organized crime unit trying to appear unsuspicious. I have no doubt that as soon as a camera is detected within a certain radius, all the penguins immediately drop whatever tools they have, cover it with a bit of snow, and then stand around nonchalantly as if they enjoy that sort of weather. I am sure that the penguins make full use of blizzards to cover their covert operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why else would they have chosen to live on a practically uninhabited continent that is plagued by horrible weather and ridiculously long nights for half the year.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7787706001737581355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7787706001737581355&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7787706001737581355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7787706001737581355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/02/on-end-of-world.html' title='On the End of the World...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6495431022476727484</id><published>2010-02-07T15:03:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T12:58:47.227+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On slightly stupid spiders...</title><content type='html'>... in slippers sliding into stuff while spinning in the snow on slippery slopes.

It can be used to unlock one of the greatest secrets to the overwhelming success of the human race. There is no doubt that humans dominate our planet, and there is no doubt that they do this only because of the technology at their disposal. Humans often claim that the reason they have so much technology is that their intelligence is far superior to that of any other creature on the planet. Without focusing on the arrogance of the statement, I’d like to point out that, in a sense, the opposite is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: maybe I will focus just a little on the arrogance of the statement. Whoever came up with the idea that humans are smarter than animals obviously never had any pets (except for maybe some fish) and had very little contact with the outside world. The majority of dogs and cats I have encountered have been smarter than several people I have encountered. I am certain that my dog is more intelligent that at least two thirds of the people I have ever met.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that the human race is where it is today is purely because we are a race driven by pity. Not all of us... I admit that much. In fact, there are only just enough pity-driven people so that most acts of cruelty are frowned upon by the general society, but that is all it takes. In nature, most animals, if they look after their young at all, tend to ignore those animals with severe handicaps. It’s a matter of survival. These animals slow the group down, and there is little benefit to the group in keeping them. Humans, on the other hand, tend to look after the handicapped. A look at the social divisions within any school will show you this. In general, the children who are physically stronger and perform better at activities that would be useful to animals in the wild (such as sports, which simulate both hunting prey and evading predators) are less likely to come up with some invention. It is the physically inferior children who tend to advance technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example the neighbouring nations of Sparta and the Greece. The Spartans would kill any infant who showed any physical weakness whatsoever, and their upbringing was such that any child who could not cope with a highly competitive life style would not make it to adulthood. Every child was raised to be a soldier. The Greeks were different. Children were allowed to choose their path in life. Greece became a thriving nation, with the world’s most advanced philosophers, and an extremely good understanding of architecture, shipbuilding and economics. Sparta was stuck in a technological rut for its entire history, and added absolutely no knowledge to the human race. Even their military strategies were merely adaptations of strategies used by older nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, cast your mind back to the beginning – the instant that the human race made the single discovery that would separate us from animals forever. Forget the opposable thumbs – most apes, monkeys and bears have those too. Forget even the tool use – there are thousands of other species who have worked out how to use tools for a variety of uses... even octopi can use tools. The one discovery that no other species has made is the secret of creating fire. It happened so long ago that particular day is now long forgotten. There is little doubt that man already knew fire well, from natural fires in the grasslands of Africa. There is also little doubt that the first fires were started from the sparks produced from a piece of flint – what amounts to little more than bashing rocks together. In my opinion, there is no doubt that the discovery of fire was made by a retarded kid who was sitting on a bed of dry grass, bashing rocks together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human race is only the dominant species on this planet because we do not kill off the retards.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8168232494111633194/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8168232494111633194&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8168232494111633194'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8168232494111633194'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/01/on-history-and-single-strength-of-human.html' title='On History and the Single Strength of the Human Race'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5508449570495819752</id><published>2010-01-31T17:55:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-03T15:02:47.723+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertising'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Music Advertising</title><content type='html'>Why is it that whenever a compilation album is advertised on the radio or TV, they claim that all my favourite tracks are now on one CD?

She loves reading mystery novels and watching crime dramas on TV. One show she has been watching recently is &lt;i&gt;Midsomer Murders&lt;/i&gt;, and she really enjoys it. I, on the other hand, find that sort of show rather disturbing.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; People complain about crime here in South Africa, but the crime in the county of Midsomer is really out of control. It is a quiet county, mostly populated by little old ladies who would list their hobbies as knitting, gardening and drinking tea, yet their murder rate has to be one of the highest in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat more disturbing is the show &lt;i&gt;Murder, She Wrote&lt;/i&gt;. This follows an old lady who travels around the world. Where ever she goes, people are murdered with alarming regularity... through a total of 243 episodes, each containing at least one murder. Surely a person with such a reputation should be prevented from travelling. No one is safe with people like that out there.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/597162292047039711/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=597162292047039711&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/597162292047039711'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/597162292047039711'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/01/on-murderous-old-ladies.html' title='On Murderous Old Ladies'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4331366706035001158</id><published>2010-01-17T14:49:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-03T15:02:47.724+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><title type='text'>On Legos</title><content type='html'>This blog was never meant to be a platform for me to whine about all the stupid things in the world, but it really does seem as if that’s what’s happened.

(Actually not the first... I had a blog before... but I forgot my password... and I forgot where I’d put it.)&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Since then, the blog has been accessed over 500 times, resulting in over 2000 pages being loaded Not that that’s that impressive... What is impressive is the 87% return rate. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still impressed with those Americans who find my blog in Google, desperately wanting to know how to get a pig to mate with a sheep, wanting to find out if rabbits can eat chicken, or paranoid that ants are busy eating their houses out from under them, or wanting to know if squirrels lay eggs. I hope all your questions were answered... But it's not just them. It's people from all over the world. Here's a nice map of the visitors over the last couple of months. The Brazilians seem to have drifted off... and I'm still waiting for China and Japan to find me, but otherwise, I'm pretty proud of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img ps="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/S1M-RXA1cOI/AAAAAAAAAD0/Vm180D2LY8Q/s400/map1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I’ll have something about those slightly stupid spiders in slippers sliding into stuff while spinning in the snow on slippery slopes soon, but it seems to be taking a while. Other than that, I hope I’m bored enough to keep this going for another year, but not so bored that my imagination falls asleep again...

I’m not sure, but who really knows. During an amazing meal of a pineapple and chicken dish my mom occasionally makes, I was chewing perhaps a little too enthusiastically (although it really wasn’t necessary – the chicken was soft and tender), and I bit my tongue.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I do it often (maybe I should review my eating habits), so I’m used to it by now. The taste of blood in my mouth and the sharp pain are tolerable, and it’s easy enough to just get on with the meal, especially if it's a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that, this time, it would not heal. Every time I ate, there was a sharp pain from the side of my tongue. It called for a rinsing of anti-something-or-other mouthwash, which is all very well. The stuff definitely works, but along with the something-or-other bacteria or whatever that it destroys, it also destroys any taste buds in your mouth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 18 hours ago, and you’d think any numbness caused would have worn off by now, but it hasn’t. I just ate a sandwich, and I’m sure it had beef on it. At least, that’s what it looked like, but it really tasted exactly how I’d imagine asparagus flavoured porridge to taste. I really hope new taste buds grow, because I rather enjoy my food. It would be terrible if everything tasted like this forever...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8259560456838016952/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8259560456838016952&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8259560456838016952'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8259560456838016952'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/12/on-asparagus-porridge.html' title='On Asparagus Porridge'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-778897343345695241</id><published>2009-12-13T16:05:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:34:36.611+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On "Walkies"</title><content type='html'>There is a woman who lives down the road from me. She is about fortyish with long blond hair, and a pointy nose, and a dress sense that immediately places her in the stereotype that screams out that, twenty years ago, this woman was an activist for any cause there was.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It also hints that the woman believes in “new age” something or other, and reads a lot about “spiritual” whatevers. (On a side note: stereotypes are usually right.) She also believes that animals should not be confined. This makes life interesting when she takes her dogs (of which she has five) for their daily walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the word “takes her dogs for” is a little inaccurate here. A far more accurate way of putting it would possibly be “lets her dogs have”. Or maybe, “frees some untrained animals for”. The gate to her property opens, at some point in the afternoon each day, and three of the dogs begin causing chaos in the neighbourhood (I have seen the other two leave the property only once). She walks around the block three times, before returning to her house, waiting for all of the animals to return, and then shuts the gate. In the time she spends walking, the only time a dog will come within two hundred metres of her is when one comes tearing past, chasing a car, butterfly or imaginary scent. In the mean time, the dogs dig up pavements, start fights through fences, and make futile attempts at mating with everything in sight, be it dog, cat, peacock or bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the strangest dog walker in our neighbourhood though. There is another woman who is too lazy to go walking. Instead, she leans out the window of her BMW, holding the leashes for her two dogs as she drives around the block. I used to think this was rather special, until a couple of days ago. Driving past a park, I saw a red 4x4 driving off-road through the park, with a dog on a leash held by an arm out the window. I wonder where laziness will have taken us in a hundred years time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/778897343345695241/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=778897343345695241&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/778897343345695241'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/778897343345695241'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/12/on-walkies.html' title='On &quot;Walkies&quot;'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3921846365391623835</id><published>2009-12-06T18:51:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:58:43.561+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Fruit Arithmatic</title><content type='html'>Don’t worry, no advanced mathematics here.

Greek letters being used for artistic effect instead of the conventional Roman letters. Too look different, I guess.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I’m guilty of it too, sometimes. I’ve used a ‘γ’ to replace a ‘y’ even though it’s pronounced like a ‘g’. I’ve also used an ‘η’ instead of an ‘n’, even though it should be pronounced ‘ee’. I do it, but it’s still funny when I see it done elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the title of a DVD recently, I saw a ‘Π’ used instead on ‘N’, and it lead me to wonder. Are the people who did that aware that ‘Π’ is pronounced the same as a roman ‘P’, and that the Greek ‘ρ’, which I’ve seen used in place of a Roman ‘p’ (which would have been fine if it was a capital) is actually pronounced as the Roman ‘r’. And then there’s ‘χ’ to replace ‘X’, as in ‘LaTeχ’, where ‘χ’ is pronounced as a good phlegmy ‘ch’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn’t confusing enough, using ‘β’ instead of ‘b’ is all very well, since it is pronounced the same in the Greek and Roman systems, but if a German were to pick it up, he’d be seriously confused, since to him, ‘β’ is pronounced as a solid ‘ss’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7165991671319936791/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7165991671319936791&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7165991671319936791'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7165991671319936791'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/12/on-alphabet-confusion.html' title='On Alphabet Confusion'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2345707686413632648</id><published>2009-11-29T13:36:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:11:29.611+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='time'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On a Misconception in the Chronological Succession of Mathematics</title><content type='html'>I was watching Mythbusters on the Discovery Channel the other day, when an announcement came on, warning that the next scene had an unusually high science content. I understand that not everyone is mathematically or scientifically inclined, and that possibly, they actually don’t care about the maths. Of course, I’d rather no one had a panic attack when coming across some unexpected mathematics, so in future, I’ll be employing a sign.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;, Courier, monospace;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red; font-family: Times, &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;, serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&amp;nbsp;HIGH MATHEMATICAL CONTENT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;If you wish to remain socially functional, do not pay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;to much attention to the technical details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you are already socially dysfunctional, there's not much more damage that can be done, so I guess there’s no harm in reading on. If you are not mathematically inclined, but ignored my warning, it’s probably OK. There's actually not too much maths here. If you think back to high school, you’ll probably remember calculus. You may not remember what it involved, but you remember the name. If I mention the term differentiation, you may vaguely remember it. You may have forgotten how to do it, but the term sticks in your head. You may not remember integration. I certainly don’t, at least not from the high school syllabus. If you have any tertiary training in maths, however, you will probably remember these all too well, probably to the point of being sick of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up, the interaction between any two interdependent properties can be described by a mathematical function. Calculus involves using this function to extract information about this interaction from the function. Differentiation is an operation which extracts information about how the interaction changes at a specific point, while integration does the opposite, and extracts information about the whole range of possible interactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differentiation is quite simple, and taught in schools. Integration is usually quite challenging, and is left until university. It’s amazing how people simply jump to conclusions and assume that differentiation was invented first. The truth is that integration came first. Several thousand years first, actually. It’s a bit of a surprise to most, but quite obvious if you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking in the simplest terms, with the two properties that interact giving the length and breadth of the walls of a room, then integration will give you the area, whereas differentiation will tell you how skew the one wall is. Now if you imagine extending this to a field. Integration will tell you how many seeds to buy to plant in the field, whereas differentiation will tell you, well, pretty much nothing. And the integration for a rectangular field is really simple, because it all just turns out to be length times breadth – a calculation any eight year old can do. The derivative is also simple. The derivative is also really simple. It's zero, as long as the fence is straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2345707686413632648/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2345707686413632648&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2345707686413632648'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2345707686413632648'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/11/i-was-watching-mythbusters-on-discovery.html' title='On a Misconception in the Chronological Succession of Mathematics'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2608617718357112708</id><published>2009-11-29T12:30:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:17:22.275+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Layered Meals...</title><content type='html'>… like lasagna or cottage pie, that are cooked in alternating layers.

To my knowledge, the generally accepted practice is that the phone call is initiated because the caller wishes to start a conversation with the callee. If the caller did not wish to have a conversation, then he would not call.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It seemed straight forward and sensible. On a similar note, the callee has no way of knowing the caller's intended topic until the caller reveals it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pick up the phone, and respond simply with "Hello?" I never give my name at the end, because who ever is on the other end ought to know who they are calling, otherwise chances are they don't need to know. If they have my number, but not my name, then I'm not sure I want them to know my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this week, the phone rang, and I answered with my usual "Hello?" The caller responded with "Hello." and waited for me to respond. I realised then that there was a rather obvious gap in my understanding of the accepted procedure. What happens if the caller does not initiate the conversation. It should occur to him that I was probably doing something else when the phone rang, and I would prefer to continue doing that. While I'd be perfectly happy to have a meaningful conversation with someone, I have (slightly) better things to do than start conversations with complete strangers. If I wanted to do that, I'd phone a complete stranger, wouldn't I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't sure what to do, so I resorted to the age old human tactic of forgetting the whole thing. I started again, working on a little more of a questioning tone. "Hello?". And the response came: "Hello." and then nothing. I waited a while, and then started the process again. On the third try, I think he finally realised what was happening, and introduced himself, and told me what he was calling for. I wasn't paying enough attention to know what he wanted, so I told him to try calling my father, and hung up. If he didn't have the number, it was too bad. It couldn't have been important, because he would have caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: If he was a salesman, and he did happen to have my father's number, he would have been my luck. While most people get annoyed to receive a sales call during supper, my father will be genuinly interested. He'd ask a few questions, and then turn to my mother, cover the phone mouthpiece, and say, "They're redoing gutters in our area, do we need our's done?" My mother often has to take the phone from him to tell the salesperson that we are not interested. When she doesn't, we occasionally get a random room in our house shampooed and cleaned for free. We've also had far more valuations done on our home than I think is necessary.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5867598011398053005/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5867598011398053005&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5867598011398053005'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5867598011398053005'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/11/on-starting-conversations.html' title='On Starting Conversations'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3127578890876812076</id><published>2009-11-08T15:42:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T14:07:58.607+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>On "the Rest is History"</title><content type='html'>It's a hilarious way to end a story, because it implies that what has been told up to that point is not history.

In the end, most new cars are only modifications of previous models, so surely it’s far more efficient to focus their energy on fixing up the current model?&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The car manufacturers say that it’s to encourage creativity, and thinking out of the box, and that thousands of new ideas on the concept cars get incorporated into production cars. I disagree. I think it’s a natural and necessary form of procrastination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final design project was due this week, and, like every project I’ve done since I started primary school, things seemed to drag out until the last minute, regardless of how much work had been put in before the deadline. Perhaps it’s a bit late to realize this now, but I’ve finally worked out why. It’s exactly what drives engineers to develop fancy concept cars. There are aspects of any project that are really boring (like paperwork), and then there are aspects that are enjoyable (like creative design work). It’s only natural that any work that takes place a long time before the deadline will be the more enjoyable work, i.e. the creative design work. That’s why, when engineers are told to come up with the next new model of car, a fair portion of their time goes into stuff that they know will never be used. Rather than waste this time, car companies release the results as “concept” cars, and make it seem deliberate, even though it’s really an unwanted byproduct of the thought process.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5253220809125639943/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5253220809125639943&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5253220809125639943'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5253220809125639943'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/10/on-procrastination.html' title='On Procrastination'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6856060199395203916</id><published>2009-10-11T17:27:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:59:07.232+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='time'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Faces in the Clock</title><content type='html'>I’ve never had a problem sleeping. I can sleep anywhere, at any time, in any position. It does, however, take two or three minutes to kick in. Every night, I lie in bed on my left hand side, and my digital clock stares at me from across the room. It may be weird, but in those last few moments before I fall asleep, I see faces in the clock.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the colon in the middle that does it, I think. Especially since, normally, when I go to bed, the clock reads 21 something. The two little lines of the one make straight eyebrows above the little beady eyes, and the two forms a wavy hairstyle. Most of the time, the face just stares at me both noseless and expressionless, or has an open mouth, gaping in shock, possibly at its oddly shaped chin which twists its shape every minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What amazes me most is after half past, the way a face with huge flaring nostrils, sticking it tongue out at me at 21:36 can suddenly transform into a face with a long thin nose and a curly mustache and a neat collar by 21:37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6856060199395203916/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6856060199395203916&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6856060199395203916'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6856060199395203916'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/10/on-faces-in-clock.html' title='On the Faces in the Clock'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4118406895522527766</id><published>2009-10-11T16:06:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.399+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertising'/><title type='text'>On Promotions</title><content type='html'>Of products, not people, although I’ve never really understood why the same word is used for both when they’re completely different.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I saw a poster in a store reading something like “Buy any two Coca-cola products and get a watch or squeeze bottle free.” The promotion itself is not that funny.

The funniest bit is when there is no history to back it up. When the stories are distorted and only half carried, and a quarter dragged, from one generation to the next, while the remaining quarter gets left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funnier still is when someone believes that they are an expert on their own culture.

The fact that I don’t earn very much money myself does play a bit of a role, but I think the biggest factor is that I don’t get much out of it. People say you should do it to feel good, to get the “warm fuzzy feeling”. Unfortunately, I don’t get those feelings.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Maybe it makes me a horrible person, but I really don’t care. They say I should do it to make a difference in the world. I agree, it is possible to make a difference, bit by bit. But do I really want to encourage the idea that you can make money by doing nothing? A world where those who earn lose everything and those who don’t get given everything for free is not really a world I want to live in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not trying to discourage you from giving. If you do, then good for you. Please carry on. I’d hate to see people starve because of something I’ve said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week or two ago, I saw a beggar that I had to give money to. It was a teenager wearing tattered clothes, and barefoot on the hot tar. He was carrying a worn cardboard sign, reading “No food, no job. Seven children to feed, and all my girlfriends and both wives are pregnant. Please help.” As he passed my car, I watched him in the rear-view mirror. The back of his sign read “My dog ate my brother’s soccer boots and got arrested. I need money for the bail. Please help.” Whoever he is, even if he's a multi-millionaire, he deserves every cent he was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1334201184467136239/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1334201184467136239&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1334201184467136239'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1334201184467136239'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/10/on-begging.html' title='On Begging'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2700757778994541076</id><published>2009-10-02T09:07:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T14:59:14.496+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='luck'/><title type='text'>On Not Very Much On Luck Part II</title><content type='html'>We have a garden service that comes every now and then to spray our lawn to kill the weeds. First they spray a liquid fertiliser, which makes the weeds grow like crazy, and then they come back a week later, and spray poison on the weeds.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It used to be really effective, but not so much anymore. They came three weeks ago, and the weeds are already coming back. Especially the clovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m starting to wonder; maybe the clovers are growing immune to the poison. Maybe the poison is just making them mutate. I hust happened to glance at the ground, and I found my second four leaf clover in the space of six days. Once again it led to something big happening that I guess could be attributed to luck. I thought that maybe all the clovers had four leaves, but they did not. The one I found was the only one. Maybe I’m just extremely lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder when the neighbourhood will start getting three eyed cats wondering around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2700757778994541076/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2700757778994541076&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2700757778994541076'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2700757778994541076'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/10/on-not-very-much-on-luck-part-ii.html' title='On Not Very Much On Luck Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-323897342489559878</id><published>2009-09-27T17:48:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T14:13:29.497+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='luck'/><title type='text'>On Luck</title><content type='html'>I found a four leaf clover on Friday.

It’s a complicated process developed over the last twenty years of my life, and I have no idea how it started. It’s probably OCD, but I can’t guarantee that. It might be related to whatever it is that makes me arrange my books in descending height order on my shelves, and use a ruler to make sure they line up with the spines the same distance from the front of the shelf. It might also have to do with the fact that I keep a spirit level in my room to make sure the pictures are straight on the wall.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It’s not that I’m a neat freak – a single glance at anything I own will instantly disprove that – but it’s just some inexplicable urge inside that makes me want to do things a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not rules, you must understand. I am not bound by them. When it comes to eating, I actually break them all the time. I really just eat things in the order I prefer. It's actually a coincidence that the order is so technical. In fact, it’s actually a simple case of “save the best for last”, combined with the fact that I don’t like mixed flavours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I eat, I always start with the vegetables. If there are a variety of vegetables on the plate, it really depends on which vegetables I prefer. It’s purely coincidence that I normally eat vegetables in descending order of the wavelength of their reflected light. The order is slightly mixed up. I start on green, and then work my way down the wavelengths to purple. I then take a jump up in wavelength, and then work my way down through red and orange and finally finish off on yellow. I then work in ascending order of luminosity. Darker vegetables are eaten first, while lighter vegetables are eaten afterward. Inevitably, this leads me to eating the starch last. One exception to the above rule is if the vegetable are those that are contained within something else, such as a sauce, or vegetables on a roll, or in a pie. The loose vegetables are dealt with first, and then I move on to the rest. Another exception is made with vegetables that are essentially the same as another vegetable of a different colour. In these cases, both types are grouped into one of the vegetables. For example, red and yellow peppers are classified as dark green, because they are basically the same as green peppers. Likewise, broccoli is classified as almost white, since it’s not really that different to cauliflower (and I just happen to really like broccoli). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the vegetables are out of the way, I get to the real food. The principle here is simple. Vegetables go in the same order as described above, then meat, and cheese always comes last. For example, a typical burger will be eaten in the following order: lettuce; tomato; onion; bun; patty (although this may be shortened by eating the bun with one or more of the garnish ingredients in, to save time. The patty is only included in the case of takeaways, in which case taking a burger apart is awkward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few exceptions: pasta comes after meat, but before cheese; pickles come after meat but before pasta; and guacamole or avocado comes before meat and after starch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I eat each stage, I make sure that no food is wasted. I get as many crumbs off the plate as possible without putting in much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think I’m crazy, I agree. I’ll accept any donations towards psychiatrist fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/591630125321202551/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=591630125321202551&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/591630125321202551'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/591630125321202551'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-eating-in-order.html' title='On Eating in Order'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7596091460967342422</id><published>2009-09-27T15:15:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T12:58:57.865+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Not Very Much</title><content type='html'>Take a breath, because this is quite a sentence.

As in the address to this blog. It’s not that difficult to get. I understand when a person accidentally calls it ‘alphanumericsheepdog’, and that’s OK. Even I occasionally throw a goat in.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; (Not literally, mind you. Goats, like &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-tossing-sheep.html"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, are rather difficult to throw. Rabbits are much easier to throw, but I don’t tend to throw them in that often.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I cannot understand is ‘alphantoesicrifersii’. It’s not even a word. Google currently returns zero results for it. It does not exist in the public space on the internet, and, as far as I’m concerned, that means it does not exist. I suspect that by tomorrow, Google will have found it, but that’s what Google is. Google is the collective mind of the human race, so if one man makes something up, then so does Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Alphantoesicrifersii’ is what my cellphone’s predictive text setting offers me when I type ‘alphanumericsheeppig’. I’ve always wondered what made the programmer put that in. Is it unique to my cellphone? And what does it mean? Does it even have a meaning? If not, then does that mean that I am allowed to give a meaning to it? Surely if my meaning gets generally accepted, then the word will be included in a dictionary, and I will have made a contribution to the English language. It’s unlikely, but it would be nice. All I need is for everyone I know to use the word regularly in casual conversation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new definition is:&lt;br /&gt;Alphantoesicrifersii: &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;/‘æl.f æn.tuː.zɪk . /hɜː. rɪf. ər. siː/&lt;/span&gt; (v.)

I’m quite proud of this, since it’s a scientific topic (probably from a 10 year old, but still). The answer is quite simply zero.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Once it has landed, it has no kinetic energy. If we&amp;nbsp;change the question slightly, and&amp;nbsp;consider a pencil&amp;nbsp;an instant before it lands on the carpet, things become&amp;nbsp;a bit more interesting.&amp;nbsp;Neglecting air friction, and assuming an average sized wooden pencil dropped from an average table, you’re looking at about 30 mJ, or in imperial units, 0.007 cal. If you’re looking at the explosive energy (as in kiloton explosive), it’s about 7 millionths of a gram. Not very worthwhile, if you ask me. If you want to drop a decent amount of kinetic energy on your carpet, consider dropping a truck off a cliff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking air resistance&amp;nbsp;into account (since I have no excuses), you’ll have a Reynold’s number of about 2000 (at sea level on a slightly warm day), nowhere near enough to cause turbulence in the boundary layer, and lose about 0.7 mJ if the pencil falls sideward. If the pencil falls point down, then your Reynold’s number is a bit higher at 40000, which means you’ve got slightly less skin friction. Not to mention that the pressure drag is way down. If that happens, you only lose about 0.1 mJ of kinetic energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet your Google search didn’t tell you that… all you would have found, if you&amp;nbsp;fixed up your search,&amp;nbsp;was the good old Ek = ½.m.v^2 and Ep = m.g.h formulae.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5693691267276321440/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5693691267276321440&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5693691267276321440'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5693691267276321440'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-google-part-viii-pencils-kinetic.html' title='On Google Part VIII: A Pencil&apos;s Kinetic Energy'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3316593332182024222</id><published>2009-09-20T17:39:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2012-02-06T12:24:02.596+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shopping'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><title type='text'>On Convenient Parking Spaces</title><content type='html'>I have seen this twice in the past couple of weeks – once at university and once at a shopping centre.

It’s amazing what lengths people go through to make their product seem appealing. A recent campaign on billboards throughout the city made me laugh, but here’s another advert that made me laugh a bit. How it is relevant, I don’t know.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SrYwGBU7dnI/AAAAAAAAADM/TvoUj9NI2L4/s1600-h/ad1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" iq="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SrYwGBU7dnI/AAAAAAAAADM/TvoUj9NI2L4/s400/ad1.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was just a diversion. The thing I really wanted to talk about is the recent advertising campaign around the city by Multichoice, advertising DSTV. They use three mini-billboards attached to three consecutive street light poles. They show a single scoop ice-cream for R5 a day and advertise a basic package. Then a double scoop ice-cream for R8 a day, and advertise a medium level package. Then they show a triple scoop ice-cream for R15 a day, and advertise a full package. The intention is to say that DSTV is cheap and affordable if you look at it on a daily cost basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, if I had the choice between DSTV and a triple scoop ice-cream, then ignoring the health risks, I’d take a triple scoop ice-cream every day. I understand that they are just trying to say that sacrificing just one ice-cream a day is all you need to do to afford DSTV. The problem is that I do not know a single person who has ice-cream every day. I probably never will, since they’re probably too huge to make it through the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing reminds me of a life insurance advert that used to be on TV when I was in high school. It was a ridiculously long advert. I think it was during the infomercials (which I used to watch during school holidays, having not much else to do). I remember the line “For no more than the price of a sandwich a day, you and your family can have the cover they deserve.” It’s a good point, but the choice of airing time was a bit poor. They used to show shortly before noon – roughly the time my stomach was starting to point out (rather loudly, the way someone would point something out after a night (and probably afternoon and morning) of non-stop drinking) that a sandwich would be a much more welcome right then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you expect people to sacrifice a meal for your product, then it had better be an incredible product.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8312191911397304064/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8312191911397304064&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8312191911397304064'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8312191911397304064'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/advertising-can-be-hilarious.html' title='On Advertising'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SrYwGBU7dnI/AAAAAAAAADM/TvoUj9NI2L4/s72-c/ad1.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6695743745773788745</id><published>2009-09-20T15:14:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:08:02.346+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='doors'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Door Handle Sparks</title><content type='html'>It’s quite annoying that door handles enjoy shocking people that use them. I understand that they might want to be left alone, but some of us need to go places, and it’s really inconsiderate to play practical jokes like that. Why can’t all door handles be made of plastic (like on car doors), so that they don’t shoot of sparks.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The computer labs at university are particularly guilty of this. I can avoid getting the unexpected shock by expecting it. This makes it much more bearable. I brush the back of my hand against the handle to discharge it first. I still get shocked, but at least it’s not unexpected. This habit has probably made it much worse for me when I actually do get shocked unexpectedly. When leaving the computer lab, the door is unlocked by moving your student card across a sensor. My student card is connected to a chain of key rings, with a key on the end. Occasionally, the key swings and bumps the metal door frame. Occasionally, part of a key ring is touching the palm of my hand. People always stare when you suddenly jump and pull your hand back, causing the keys to jingle. It would probably be quite funny to watch, if it were someone else doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6695743745773788745/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6695743745773788745&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6695743745773788745'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6695743745773788745'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-door-handle-sparks.html' title='On Door Handle Sparks'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1483327712125084789</id><published>2009-09-20T14:49:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:08:06.528+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='people'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weather'/><title type='text'>On Pointing Things Out</title><content type='html'>My mind is quite simple. It can only focus on a very limited number of things at a time. I also think very deeply, and slowly, and when I do, I am essentially disconnected from the outside world. Because of this, I usually don’t notice something until its pointed out.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When winter gets going, I don’t notice the weather changing. I wake up each morning, and get dressed for summer. Yes, it might be cold then, and it probably is, but how am I supposed to know. I don’t religiously watch weather reports or read thermometers. (I actually do have a thermometer next to my bed, but apart from a midsummer evening (when it is accurate to within 2°C) it says nothing more than too hot or too cold. The problem is that it’s been there for the last ten years, so I don’t notice it anymore.) Several hours later someone asks me, “Aren’t you cold?” It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and then I’m shivering for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People that point things out are very inconsiderate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are doing road works late at night not that far from my house. If the wind is just right (which it has been for the last couple of weeks), then the beeping of reversing trucks travels through the air and reaches my house. It’s actually quite loud, but I didn’t notice until my mother mentioned that she hadn’t been able to sleep for two nights because of it. Of course, that night, I kept hearing the beeping. (Luckily, it didn’t affect my sleep. I could sleep through the end of the world.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People shouldn’t point out annoying things.

Ten years ago, people would have said “taking a long-term view”, but over the last few months, people have started saying “looking at things going forward”. It’s strange watching language evolve right in front of your eyes.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I understand that it is the popular way to put it at the moment, and that it’s trying to sound modern, but it really does sound like they’re adapting their speech for a &lt;a href=http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish&gt;Wikipedia Simple English&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always wondered how these things started out. I can see one person in an office who wants to sound modern and different. (Probably the guy who’s away every second week on a “effective management” course, and not embarrassed to wear a bright yellow shirt to a meeting. He doesn’t wear ties, but if he did, it would probably be neon purple. In other words, the attention seeker.) He’s sick of hearing everyone using the same words, so he comes up with a new way of saying something, just to sound different. Because its so funny, everyone starts mimicking it, and before they know it, they start using his words unintentionally. At first it is “Bob in the corner office” who has the weird way of talking. Then suddenly it’s “those guys in marketing”, then “those guys on the seventh floor”. For a brief time, it becomes “those guys at head office”, and then suddenly, no one notices any more since it’s the accepted way. Suddenly, the previous term sounds old fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: This whole idea of a large group picking up a mannerism from some one else happens all the time. In third year, we had a lecturer who ended every sentence with a ‘with’ or ‘of’. He had very good technical English, and would give a clear and well structured sentence and end off with an ‘of’. “The controller sends a 24V signal which triggers the contactor, and this switches off the motor of.” I can’t say that it wasn’t funny, and in time, some of my classmates (me included) found ourselves doing it occasionally. It took a couple of months to lose the habit.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4901400669631666571/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4901400669631666571&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4901400669631666571'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4901400669631666571'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-going-forward-in-simple-english.html' title='On Going Forward in Simple English'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4369732576146443916</id><published>2009-09-13T16:02:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:11:01.803+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jokes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weather'/><title type='text'>On Some Vaguely Related Ideas</title><content type='html'>It’s been winter for so long now, but it’s finally over. Spring is here, and the insect eggs that have been lying dormant for the last six months are starting to hatch. Those creatures that eat insects are coming out of hiding.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The birds are returning from the warmer north, and overnight, a pair of doves managed to permanently fix the pool brush to the wall with their nest. Along with the insects, the spiders have also come out of hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get away from the birds, spiders are attracted indoors, but they prefer the dark and damp places away from human activity. The perfect place is behind bookshelves, but the drains appear to offer a seemingly suitable alternative. Unfortunately, they are suitable for a single day, at most, because each evening, at more or less the same time, I run the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week ago, a spider had decided to make its home in the plughole of the bath. It was not a smart choice, although it was not a fatal mistake. Without noticing the spider, I ran the bath and got in. Relaxing in the bath, I felt a tickling feeling on my left ear. I brushed it, and thought nothing of it. But the feeling persisted, and seemed to be moving across my ear. I submerged that side of my head to try get rid of it, and when I came up, I noticed a spider floating in the water. I was raised to never hurt spiders, so I picked it up and placed it on the floor, and blew it to dry it a bit. It lay motionless for a while, but eventually got up and moved away. Thinking nothing of it, I continued with my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, while lying in bed, my ear was starting to itch slightly. By the next morning, it felt like it was on fire. By afternoon, the base of my ear was swollen and red, and the skin felt bruised. That night, the pain in my ear forced me to sleep on my right hand side, which is something I don’t often do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am deaf in my right ear, and if I block out my left ear, I shut out the world. That makes it really easy to sleep. Lying with my deaf ear against the pillow, my left ear was open to the world, and I was reminded of the loud night-time world that I was so used to being able to just switch off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear a hearing aid. I still would, if my ear didn’t reject it. I will be getting an unconventional type of hearing aid soon. It’s just a matter of waiting for the equipment to arrive in the country, and scheduling an operation. A few weeks ago, I was trying out a test version of this hearing aid, and I noticed that the volume control had numbers marked on it to indicate the level. To turn the hearing aid off, you turn the volume right down to zero. There is a slight click to indicate that the device is switched off. When you put the device on, it should be switched off; otherwise it sends really loud feedback pulsing through your skull. Once it is connected properly, then you can set the volume to the desired level, which you do by ear. You turn the wheel until it sounds right. Why do little numbers have to show the level, when the device is attached to the side of your head where you can’t see it, and you have to turn the volume off to remove the device anyway? It’s just another case of someone not thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all volume control switches, it is impossible to set it exactly where you want it. It’s always just to loud, or just to quiet. It’s like most controls, actually. Especially air conditioners. The setting you want is always in between something. The room will either be too hot or too cold. One lecture theatre at the university is particularly bad. What made things worse, was that when the unit had been installed, someone had had the idea of sealing up all the windows. The air in the room was always dry and stale, no matter what the weather outside was, and although the air conditioner has a range of temperatures which the control pad implies that it is able to maintain, the unit only ever seemed to have two settings – namely “off” and “arctic blizzard”. Having it on made the air too dry and leaving it off made the room to stuffy. Last year, our class decided that the best solution would just be to open to windows. One day, with the aid of an electric drill with a screwdriver attachment, the class managed to unseal some of the windows. It worked. The room is still never the right temperature, but at least the air is breathable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the electric drill, a couple of us decided to play a prank on a class mate. This involved drilling a couple of holes in his pencil case, and bolting it closed. A touch of super glue made sure that it would stay bolted shut permanently. This year, we played a prank on the same student. While a couple of people distracted him, someone managed to remove his calculator from his bag. During a break, a friend and I went to a nearby room and dismantled his calculator. We put it back together carefully, making sure that the ‘plus’, ‘multiply’, ‘subtract’ and ‘divide’ buttons were switched around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In primary school, when I still had a cheap simple calculator, I used to take it apart and randomly arrange the buttons so that no one would steal my calculator. There was also a polarised film over the display, and turning it over would invert the colours on the screen. I used to love the fact that my calculator looked completely different to anyone else’s. Unfortunately, my calculators are far more complicated now, and rather than using a cheap plastic film, the glass in the display is polarised. That makes the calculator slightly less customisable, and it annoys me that my calculator looks so much like everyone else’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4369732576146443916/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4369732576146443916&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4369732576146443916'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4369732576146443916'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-some-vaguely-related-ideas.html' title='On Some Vaguely Related Ideas'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6877836807039119560</id><published>2009-09-13T13:12:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-19T12:42:47.117+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chairs'/><title type='text'>On Disabled Parking</title><content type='html'>Not parking that is incapacitated, but parking that is reserved for disabled people.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the need for it.

This led to some mild confusion when someone told me “That band’s terrible.

I think its an awesome word (i.e, invokes awe). For those who don’t know, it’s the term used for the sound a birds wing makes as it moves through the air. The only nice formal definition I’ve been able to find is: skirr (skʉr): (v) to move, run, fly, etc. swiftly and, occasionally, with a whirring sound; (n) a whirring sound.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8471464709092622357/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8471464709092622357&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8471464709092622357'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8471464709092622357'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-common-language-part-ii.html' title='On Common Language Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-908303555099847377</id><published>2009-09-06T15:05:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:08:14.581+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On Pokemon</title><content type='html'>It’s a perfect example of good intentions without a thought for the consequences.

More the Gameboy games and the trading card games than the TV show.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; For those of you unfamiliar with the games, the idea is more mature than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic story line of the TV show involves a boy in a magical world with a huge variety of cute and loving creatures. For some reason, there are no schools in this world, and kids are free to wonder around and explore the world on their own. The children are encouraged to capture the creatures and care for them, and respect them. It’s a good message to send out to children. Interesting concept, but no one over the age of four would want to watch it, and no one under that age would understand the message. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the TV show was based on a series of video games, aimed at a different audience. The basic idea is that the player collects and trains an army of monsters to take part in one-on-one battles with creatures trained by others. These battles involved attacking your opponent until it "faints” (i.e. is knocked unconscious). They required an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of your monsters and their attacks, and those of your enemies. (If it weren’t for the fact that you could just level up and then be unstoppable, they would have been quite technical games.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s an interesting idea for a TV show to teach young children to respect animals, but were the Pokémon games really the best source for the story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/908303555099847377/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=908303555099847377&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/908303555099847377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/908303555099847377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-pokemon.html' title='On Pokemon'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4990746854278772837</id><published>2009-09-06T14:12:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T11:55:08.499+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><title type='text'>On Settling Houses</title><content type='html'>It’s weird how old buildings have creaks and groans. You actually expect that sort of thing to happen in horror movies, and those houses rarely disappoint. But when your own house starts doing it, it is completely unexpected.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Especially when it’s late at night, and you’re home alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The piping system in my house has always enjoyed groaning. The pipes would groan whenever a tap was turned on or off in the house, and occasionally, several minutes after a bath had been run, or someone had had a shower, there would be a series of taps and creaks from the roof as the pipes cooled down. When you hear these noises, they are not surprising, since they were caused by something you or someone else in the house did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, our house has started making the creaking, especially with the end of winter winds that always come in August. I was always led to believe that these noises were just the house “settling”. The noises don’t bother me (I actually like living in a house that likes making noises), and the problem is that I think they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who knows anything about engineering knows instinctively that an unexpected noise is the first warning that something is not right. If your car makes a clunking sound, something’s wrong. Even children know this. If you are climbing a tree, and the branch you are sitting on starts creaking and groaning, you move to a thicker branch. There is a scientific reason for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A noise happens when a large amount of energy is released in a relatively short period of time. For example, if you drop something, and it hits the ground, it makes a noise because it has to get rid of its kinetic energy to stop. Or if you snap a branch, it makes a noise because it no longer needs the energy to bond the two sections together. In the case of a structure (like a house), the only energy present is the gravitational potential energy (which is caused by the tendency of the house to fall down. The further the house has to fall, the more gravitational potential energy it has). The only way this energy can be released is in the form of kinetic energy, which means the house is moving. If this kinetic energy were to be lost (which must happen, unless the house is in a free fall), it needs to be dissipated in one of three means. Making a noise is by far the easiest. The second is breaking something, which would in turn lead to a noise. The third is heat caused through friction, which is normally accompanied by some form of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I should be worried, I think, is that each time the house creaks, it is falling slightly. Logic dictates that the house only has a finite number of these noises before it all comes crashing down. I hope it’s just an old penguin with a creaky chair that’s found its way into my roof, because I’d prefer my house to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4990746854278772837/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4990746854278772837&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4990746854278772837'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4990746854278772837'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-settling-houses.html' title='On Settling Houses'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4026476190410716741</id><published>2009-08-30T13:56:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-03T15:02:47.732+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shopping'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Stupid Parents</title><content type='html'>A child walked past earlier wearing shoes which let off a high pitched squeak with each step.

They would have given the shoes one or two experimental squeaks before buying them, and smiled at their daughter’s squeals of delight at the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embarrassingly enough, while I was typing about it, the parents walked in, this time carrying the child. They passed the child between each other, but despite the child’s obvious demands to be put down, they wouldn’t let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they’ve learnt that there’s more to life than making the child “cute”. Hopefully they’ll remember next time that they actually have to live with it.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4026476190410716741/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4026476190410716741&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4026476190410716741'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4026476190410716741'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-stupid-parents.html' title='On Stupid Parents'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1566863977093359871</id><published>2009-08-30T13:37:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-19T12:42:47.050+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='traffic'/><title type='text'>On Hydro-Processed Nanocheese</title><content type='html'>Which seems like a mouthful at first, and it is. A mouthful of hydro-processed nanocheese, as long as that’s what’s in your mouth, and your mouth is full of it. If not, then it’s not a mouthful, is it? If I haven’t lost you (although I think I just might have), then I’ll try moving faster, taking sharper corners, and being slightly less predictable.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The problem with driving like that, however, is an accident is more likely to happen. And no one likes an accident, especially if it’s a puppy that’s had an accident on the carpet. Especially if it’s your carpet. Even more especially so if you were the one who accidentally trod it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have lost you, then I recommend that you learn to read a map. Or buy a GPS, and you’ll be able to make your own way there without having to follow me. I’m not the easiest person to follow at times. I move fast and take the long route; the obscure route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Or more just an example than a side note, but I like side notes, so I’m going to call it one. Two weeks ago, I was driving somewhere, and I was stopped at a robot*. A flashing green arrow came on telling me to turn left, so I did, even though my destination was straight ahead of me. The road brought me along side a golf course. I then saw a bridge off to the side, and decided to cross it. Ten minutes later, I was driving along a ridge with one of the best views of the city I’d ever seen. I wasn’t lost, because I could see where I needed to be. I just took twenty minutes longer to get there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(* On another side note for any non-South African that might read this: robot refers to a traffic light. This reminds me of my second year applied mechanics lecturer (a mostly deaf Indian, who had studied engineering in Canada), who, in our first lecture, recalled hearing a traffic report after his first arrival in South Africa. The report had said “Robots are out at several intersections, causing chaos in the traffic.” My lecturer had then said, in an accent not too dissimilar from Apu (from The Simpsons), “This is a very technologically advanced country.” The confusion lies in the technical definition of a robot. Foreigners, think of a robot as an automated machine which replaces a human function, and not a traffic light. But a traffic light is a robot. The human function is a traffic cop directing the traffic at the intersection.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See? I like taking the long way. Have I lost you yet? Learn to read a map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with a map or GPS is that you have to know your destination, and maybe you don’t, which is why it’s important that you follow me. There is no reason for you not to know where we are going, since I think I made that quite clear from the start. The moment I typed “On Hydro-Processed Nanocheese”, in fact. The fact that I still haven’t gotten there is just more proof that I like taking the scenic route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough of that nonsense. It’s time that this thing got somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Washed” is a word that should be used with caution. It’s a simple, but powerful word that implies hard work resulting in a general cleanliness. Some people use it too casually, when they really mean “rinsed”. Then you hear those that talk about being washed in a river. In most rivers nowadays, the cleanliness implied by the word “washed” is a lie. In this case, “rinsed” is not a suitable word either, since it doesn’t convey the scrubbing and soap that went into the whole business. That is why I prefer the term “hydro-processed”. It implies nothing except that it involves some process (which may involve as little as one action), and that, somewhere along the line, it makes use of water. In other words, it means the same as “washed”, just without the implicit cleanliness. It’s definitely a better word, especially when used in conjunction with cheese, which contains several types of bacteria. (A lot of people take the word “clean” to mean the absence of bacteria, although a better term for this would be “very, very dead for a very, very long time”).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of cheese, micro cheese refers to grated cheese (in the vast world inside my head, which may vary slightly from the outside world you may be familiar with). Nanocheese is simply really finely grated cheese, or powdered cheese. The way parmesan cheese is grated. It’s quite simple really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, hydro-processed nanocheese is simply really finely grated cheese that has been rinsed in water. It probably tastes all watery, so I wouldn’t recommend it. Anyway, it all sounds like far too much effort to me. If you want cheese, its probably easier to have it straight.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1566863977093359871/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1566863977093359871&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1566863977093359871'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1566863977093359871'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-hydro-processed-nanocheese.html' title='On Hydro-Processed Nanocheese'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8095804893803914570</id><published>2009-08-30T13:25:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:10:52.792+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='libraries'/><title type='text'>On Libraries</title><content type='html'>The university recently changed the library system. Not really – it’s still the same system, but they have made changes to how it is accessed. Previously, there were several computers, logged on to the university’s intranet, with a search page open for so that anyone could simply type in a couple of keywords, click search, and would be given a list of books, showing whether these books were available or not, and if they were, then where they could be found. If you knew what you were looking for, it took less than thirty seconds to find the book.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new system uses the same computers and the same intranet site. The catch is that the computers are not logged on. Each student has a username and password, and must log on to the computer. They then need to wait while the operating system loads up, and then open the internet browser. They then need to type in the address of the search site, and wait for that to load. Only then can they search for the book. The whole process only takes a couple of minutes, but it’s still four times longer than the old system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m glad I don’t have to go through third year with that system. I remember running to the library during a tea break, since lectures ran from eight to five – the only time the library was open. I typed in a couple of keywords to find a general range of shelf numbers, and grabbed four or five random books with relevant titles, so that I could page through them at home that evening. I feel sorry for all future generations of third years…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea must have been put in their heads by the penguins.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8095804893803914570/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8095804893803914570&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8095804893803914570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8095804893803914570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-libraries.html' title='On Libraries'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6301903742384129501</id><published>2009-08-30T12:20:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:10:52.794+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='friends'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fashion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tuna'/><title type='text'>On Penguins: Part II</title><content type='html'>Actually, not on penguins at all.

As usual, I remember hardly any of it. In the dream, I was sitting at a wooden table late one afternoon, eating KFC. What I do remember is a turtle swooping out of the sky, grabbing my breakfast in its talons, and then gliding onto a brick path.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; That was mid morning. It then went into some sort of spasm, and I realized it was trying to climb out of its shell. It got out, and then began a dance on the grass in the dark, waving the steak it had stolen from me as if to say in the singsong way a five year old would, “I’ve got ice-cream, and you don’t”. There was no moon in the sky - only stars, and I could only see it dancing because of the headlights of the car I was sitting in. I know it was a turtle and not a tortoise because it had flippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that dreams are a reflection of your concerns in real life. Another theory is that they merely reveal your concerns. Others say it reveals the future. Yet more people say it is merely your mind trying to make sense of your experiences in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I say is that I hope that dream has nothing to do with real life, and was just my messed up imagination leaking into my sleep. I really hope that isn’t what the future holds. My mind is too inconsistent to hold that sort of responsibility, not to mention that I don’t like having my food stolen by flying turtles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3757134894505502092/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3757134894505502092&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3757134894505502092'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3757134894505502092'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-dreams.html' title='On Dreams'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7176217126550302740</id><published>2009-08-23T13:32:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:16:53.013+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chairs'/><title type='text'>On Chairs</title><content type='html'>Not the &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-rabid-laminated-plastic-chairs.html"&gt;rabid laminated plastic&lt;/a&gt; kind.

Before I get the scrawny pale fanboys bashing down my door, wanting to kill me, I’d like to point out the spelling is 'DotA'. Note the capitalisation of the ‘A’ and not the ‘o’ and the ‘t’. If it was supposed to be pronounced ‘doter’, as so many think it should, then it would been spelt with a small ‘a’.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; If you like to use the argument that it is an abbreviation, and so the 'A' should be a capital letter, then I applaud you. That is correct, and so the correct spelling is ‘DOTA’ which would be pronounce “dee, oh, tea, ay”. Of course, the ‘o’ and ‘t’ stand for ‘of’ and ‘the’, which are customarily not capitalised in a title, so why should they be capitalised in the abbreviation? I should point out that these words are customarily left out of abbreviations. So, DotA should be correctly abbreviated ‘DA’. If you wish to pronounce that as a single word, then it would be pronounced ‘duh’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, those that came up with the name decided to spell it ‘DotA’, and so the correct pronunciation is “dot ay”. I understand that that may not be what was intended, but I’m sorry. You can’t just change the rules of a language to suit yourself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Yes, the song does pronounce it 'doter', but they're not singing in English, are they?)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5272742320111984256/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5272742320111984256&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5272742320111984256'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5272742320111984256'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-dota.html' title='On DotA'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8735301158157193416</id><published>2009-08-16T14:53:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:23:19.242+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On the Danger of Eating Utensils</title><content type='html'>My mom used to tell me all the time.

The first relationship is that between the turtle and the arm. These two are connected through the act of biting. The second relationship is that between yourself and the arm. This is in the form of ownership. A second relationship may or may not exist between you and the arm, depend on whether it is still attached to you or not.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your arm has become detached, there is no need to deal with the turtle. Your problem is solved, and the best course of action is to leave before the turtle gets bored and decides it needs something else to chew. It’s best not to scream either, or do anything to attract attention to yourself. Just leave quietly, and then seek medical attention from someone with the appropriate qualifications (i.e. not me), and start learning to tie your shoe laces with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your arm is still attached, but you are in enough pain/shock/panic to consider allowing it to become detached, then you may remove your arm by your preferred means (or allow the turtle to do it for you). The problem is now reverts to the first case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your arm is still attached, and you would prefer it to stay that way, then the problem is somewhat less trivial. The solution mostly depends on how big the turtle is. I am talking about a giant turtle here, so if you are dealing with an ordinary turtle, my recommendation is to try Google (or Yahoo, or Bing, if you so prefer) for some other solution, because the solutions given here have not been tested with conventionally sized turtles, and cannot be guaranteed. (They actually haven’t been tested with any turtles, but that’s not the point.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the turtle is massive (i.e. with a significant gravitational pull when compared to, say, a typical planet), it’s your own fault. You should have seen it coming and moved your arm out of the way. Your arm is gone, and there’s not much you can do. It’s not too serious though, because it’s unlikely that the turtle can see you, so you should just get out of the way of its next bite. Dodge its head, and its own gravitational pull should send you into orbit. It’ll be a few hours at least before you come round to its head again. If you are smart, you will set your trajectory to land on its tail. Don’t attempt to land anywhere else, unless you have a parachute, or some other means to control your decent. (The turtle must have its own atmosphere in order to protect itself from cosmic radiation, so a parachute should more or less work.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the turtle is simply big (i.e. in the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter), there is no need to deal with the turtle. It will be killed by cosmic radiation in a matter of minutes. (Even if its on a planet, it will stick out too much to benefit from the atmosphere, and it’s just too small to hold an atmosphere of its own.) You just need to worry about the fall back to the ground. There is not much you can do if the turtle does not let go of your arm as it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the turtle is big enough that the width of its head exceeds the length of your arm, there is still not much you can do about your arm. Punching the turtle may not have much effect, depending on the size of the turtle. It is still worth a try. You may have to remove your arm as in the second case above, and then maintain the maximum possible distance between the turtle and yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the turtle weighs more than, say, 40 kg, it will be unwise to anger it. It is best not to try hitting it, since it is likely to bite harder. The best way to deal with it is to coax it off with something else. It’s more likely to be attracted by something strong smelling. The choice in substance is largely determined by what is readily available, but it may be a good idea to choose something that will wash off easily. The turtle may seem like a serious problem at the time, but a hand that smells of rotten fish for the rest off your life may be slightly less desirable in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the turtle is light enough that you can lift it, the temptation is to smash its head against a rock (there, I’ve now used that word). It is important to fight this urge, and not do it. The turtle will let go just before the impact, and you will look like an idiot when you smash your arm against the rock. It may also hurt. The best course of action is the strong smelling substance as above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if the turtle has been trained in ninjutsu by a similarly giant sewer-dwelling rat, can you please get me an autograph while its there.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8204390048879605108/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8204390048879605108&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8204390048879605108'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8204390048879605108'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-dealing-with-giant-turtle-biting.html' title='On Dealing with a Giant Turtle Biting Your Arm'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3646976400717677967</id><published>2009-08-16T12:04:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T14:27:24.032+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On a More Serious Note</title><content type='html'>Who ever it is who's responsible for that damned DDOS attack on twitter, Facebook and Blogger needs to come here to get my shoe up their backside.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; But of course, you're not going to take the time to read my blog, are you?

The salesman will always be vague about what he is selling, and tell a long story first. The reason for this is simple. He's got a job to do, and that is to try selling his merchandise. He doesn't have to actually sell anything, but just try.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; He is vague in the hopes that you will agree to buy something without knowing what it is, or because you think it may be for a good cause, and if not, then at least he has spent a lot of time working to earn his pay. It's better to be long-winded and vague with ten people a day, and have two people buying products that they thought did something else, than to be brief and clear to a hundred people, and have all of them tell you they won't buy it because they don't need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selling yourself is exactly the same thing (for those who have minds that jump to those sort of thoughts, I'm too lazy to think of a way to say that in such a way that it can't be made to sound like I'm talking about prostitutes. Really, if you like doing that sort of thing (twisting words, I mean – not doing prostitutes), you really will be able to twist anything I say.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a serious side note: What is the correct standing on nested parentheses. The last paragraph was a perfect example. Do the rules of the English language allow them? If not, then why not? Why do I care? Everyone knows I’ll use them if I want (because that’s the sort of person I am).)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier, a man, whom I think was a painter, came in to the shop. I'm quite sure he wasn't a prostitute, since he had overalls, a paintbrush and a roller in a plastic bag. He could have been, but I'm not sure what would have made him think that I'd be into that sort of thing. So I'm going to assume that he wasn't. I think he might have been looking for work, but he wasn't clear. He gave a story about how he'd done jobs here and there. I’m assuming it was painting jobs. He then told me how he had done another job yesterday and was only getting paid tomorrow. I think he was trying to say he’d do a job for me now, and I’d only have to pay later. He carried on, but he was very quiet and secretive about it, so I couldn’t hear what he was talking about. He then opened his plastic bag and showed me his overalls and painting tools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t need a painter, but even if I did, I would have told him I’m not interested in what he had to offer, just to be safe.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1464531854578133631/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1464531854578133631&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1464531854578133631'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1464531854578133631'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-selling-stuff.html' title='On Selling Stuff'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6120907475965223518</id><published>2009-08-09T13:27:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T14:29:08.825+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Giving Notice</title><content type='html'>Not leaving a job or anything like that, but about the two weeks notice that Windows XP likes to give you before your password expires. It’s really just a nuisance, but I do understand why this sort of thing would be desirable.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you haven’t worked it out yet, it is to give you enough time to think of a new unbreakable password. The fact that most people don’t, and just use a password as predictable as the last is irrelevant and Microsoft cannot change that. All that they can do is give plenty of opportunities to change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for including the option to change the password immediately, instead of waiting two weeks for it to expire, is just in case the user thinks of a brilliant unbreakable password. It is quite possible that the user won’t be able to remember this password after 14 days, and so Windows allows the user to change it early. That way, at least if they forget the password, their security won’t be compromised by them using a simpler password. They won’t be able to log in, but that’s not a problem, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of logging in (actually, more along the lines of logging off),  have you noticed how, after installing a new program, as soon as you click on the Start button to log off, an excited message pops up saying “New programs  installed! Click here to see them!” It’s a brilliant marketing scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Why do you log in, and then log off? Why did they not think when they coined these terms.

I’m lucky enough to have a bit of both (trying not to sound arrogant). I think you have to be smart to spot the difference. Intelligence plays no part at all. &lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final year student, certain “duties” get dumped on us. One such “duty” is the marking of a test written by the second years. Marking the test, I came across one student who had obviously studied quite hard, and had plenty of intelligence. Unfortunately, he was not very smart. In one part of the paper, he had made one small mistake which cascaded through and lost him most of the marks for that question. For the rest of the paper, he managed to get 90% of the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the question he got wrong, the paper had asked him to calculate the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on a 100 kilogram body - a rather simple question which he got correct. (The correct answer, for those who have forgotten their high school physic, is 981 N). The trick was that they had to do it from first principles, using Newton’s law of gravitation. The trick was that the Earth’s radius was given in kilometers. It’s amazing how many people accept that you can get a force of several hundred thousand tons on a 100 g body. That’s not smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this particular student was not one of those. He made it to the second part of the question intact. The second part asked for the uncertainty in the answer of the first part, and was worth four times as many marks. This is a simple calculation, but unfortunately one that most don’t understand until they reach third year. The student in question applied the formula correctly, but made one small logic error which led to an answer of about seven billion newtons. He was intelligent, since he could obviously apply the formula, but not smart. If he was smart, he would have realised that this meant the he had no idea what the answer was, even though the number he calculated was no where near to what he should have known was the correct answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can train a chimpanzee to do maths, but it doesn’t help. Numbers are meaningless. It is only the human thought, the human understanding that lies behind it all, that counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at me. I’m such a hypocrite. When I was in second year, I failed that test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1061661485580958437/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1061661485580958437&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1061661485580958437'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1061661485580958437'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-being-smart-and-and-having.html' title='On Being Smart and and Having Intelligence'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5637295481619053856</id><published>2009-08-02T13:59:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:23:34.498+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='land marks'/><title type='text'>On Perseverance</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;I’ve reached the first landmark I set myself. This is my 100th blog post and it’s taken me 197 days (just over 17 million seconds). I wasn't sure how long I’d be able to keep it up, but it seems that I managed. I’m not sure how it happened, but I’m pretty sure it was only out of pure boredom.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SnWTeizYjzI/AAAAAAAAABs/GvBj4uka_N0/s1600-h/untitled.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365356684029497138" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 247px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 327px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SnWTeizYjzI/AAAAAAAAABs/GvBj4uka_N0/s400/untitled.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, thanks to those of you who read what I have to write. My readership is erratic, but I think it’s a miracle any of you remember to come back. You seem to average over 20 a week. Since I like graphs, I’m going to give you one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SnWM8JqJCGI/AAAAAAAAABk/oBPxv_jr9_Q/s1600-h/untitled.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365349496094525538" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 175px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SnWM8JqJCGI/AAAAAAAAABk/oBPxv_jr9_Q/s400/untitled.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since I’m an engineer, I like discussing graphs, but I’m going to try my best to refrain from discussing this one… I promise I won’t… I’m really fighting the urge… I’m sorry, I really am doing my best…Due to technical issues, the counter was down for most of week 23… I’m sorry. You must understand that this is difficult for me. I'm just disappointed that it's not climbing steadily. (Tell you friends about this blog, and make it famous...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, 30% of those readers are people who know me from university, and another 20% are friends who know me from elsewhere. What impresses me are the 8% who are Americans who find my blog in Google, desperately wanting to know how to get a pig to mate with a sheep, wanting to find out if rabbits can eat chicken, or paranoid that ants are busy eating their houses out from under them. Some of them have even come back. Then you get the ones who want to know if squirrels lay eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also interesting to note that 25% of my visitors read more than just the front page. The most popular pages seem to be the ones the ignorant masses seem to enjoy Googling. In other words, those involving the &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-destructive-potential-of-ants.html"&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-giant-rabbits-eating-salad.html"&gt;giant rabbits&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-squeezing-squirrel-eggs-from-stolen.html"&gt;squirrels eggs&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not sure why people would want to read these so much, but it’s up to them, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will hopefully have more nonsense to feed you people about slightly stupid spiders in slippers sliding into stuff while spinning in the snow on slippery slopes. If that’s the sort of thing you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next milestone is 200.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5637295481619053856/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5637295481619053856&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5637295481619053856'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5637295481619053856'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-perseverance.html' title='On Perseverance'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SnWTeizYjzI/AAAAAAAAABs/GvBj4uka_N0/s72-c/untitled.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2309935041285383883</id><published>2009-08-02T13:08:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:23:28.682+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='medicine'/><title type='text'>On ADHD and a Sprained Ankle</title><content type='html'>I sprained my ankle the Wednesday before last. Often, a sprained ankle can be too painful to walk on for the first 12 hours. Luckily, the incident that caused the injury took place in the evening, so most of those 12 hours were spent asleep.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The next morning, I could move around with a limp, and the only thing that I couldn’t manage was making my way down stairs more than one step at a time. On the Friday, my ankle seemed to be fine. A little tender still, but I seemed to be able to move around it completely without any unbearable pain. In my world, that means that it had fully healed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should probably point out how I got the injury before I continue. I was sparring at Taekwondo class against someone considerably faster than me, and a bit more experienced. He left an opening just below his ribs on his right, and I went for it side (a deliberate opening, but it was too late when I realized). I threw a turning kick with my left leg as fast as I could, but he was quicker. He mirrored my kick, but much faster, and tried to dodge at the same time. Knowing his balance was not ideal, he threw out his right arm hard to help stay upright. My leg connected with his elbow right below the ankle, and I suddenly realized why Muay Thai fighters consider the elbow to be the most powerful weapon on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn’t hurt at all. That was what confused me the most. I felt the impact, but no pain. It was only when I put my foot down that I realized I couldn’t stand. I was carried off the mats, and spent the last 20 minutes of the class massaging my ankle and trying to work out what was wrong with it. It was only a couple hours later that the pain started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Friday, I considered it to be healed. Also on Friday, the university had an open sports day, so that all the sports clubs could demonstrate what they had and attract members. (A bit of a pathetic event, since we were one of three clubs who showed up, ready to show off to a crowd of not even ten people). I had promised to demonstrate, and I thought my ankle was fine, so I did. By the time it was over, I had started the whole healing process again. I could barely walk on Friday evening, and was limping for most of Saturday. On Sunday it seemed OK, and on Monday, it fulfilled my criteria for being healed. On Monday, I went to my Taekwondo class again. I stilled considered myself healed, but by the end of the session, I couldn’t walk again. I hope I haven’t caused any permanent damage, because this time, after six days, it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about the whole thing is not that I brought myself pain. It’s my own fault. If I’d just taken it easy for a couple of days, it would have been long since healed. The problem is that I’ve also got attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Not formally, mind you, but I’m pretty sure that I was misdiagnosed. I’ve only ever been diagnosed with ADD, without the hyperactive bit, but whenever I’m trying to pay attention to something, I get twitchy. I tap patterns on surfaces, or if none is available, on my legs. If my hands are busy (like they are now), my feet take over. It’s automatic, and I have no way of controlling it. This is a real pain. At work, the chair I sit in is quite high. High enough that my legs don’t touch the ground. My hands are busy typing, and so my leg begins to shake, with my foot hanging loose. This immediately sends a burst of unbearable pain through my ankle. I can’t stop it, and it’s driving me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried hooking my leg around the leg of the chair, but that’s really uncomfortable. I need to move. It needs to be free. I don’t know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2309935041285383883/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2309935041285383883&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2309935041285383883'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2309935041285383883'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-adhd-and-sprained-ankle.html' title='On ADHD and a Sprained Ankle'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6462695694648077591</id><published>2009-07-26T17:38:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T15:16:56.319+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='restaurants'/><title type='text'>On Ostrich Cattle</title><content type='html'>Last night, I ate in a restaurant.

(I really appreciate the comments. I really wish more people would leave them, even if it doesn’t say anything.)&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a long standing question (since the ancient Greeks, as far as I know), whether or not a tree that falls in the forest makes a noise if there is no one there to hear it. It’s like the Buddhist koan “What is the sound of one hand clapping.” The answer to that is simple. The sound is a solid “whack”, just like when two hands clap. If you want proof, then simply ask a man who has only one arm to clap. He substitutes his missing arm with the side of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of the tree can be solved so simply. The answer is no, the tree does not make a sound. If you want proof, the easiest way is to put a deaf person there to listen. (Since, technically, he is not there to hear it.) Leave him alone with the tree, and then return once the tree has fallen. If he’s a nice guy, he will tell you he didn’t hear the tree make a sound. If he’s not, be prepared to dodge a fist to the face, and repeat the experiment using a different deaf person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I brought this up again is because I have managed to make observations on a similar situation involving a completely different object. My kettle, like most modern electric kettles, has an automatic switch that triggers as soon as the water starts boiling. However, the kettle is not as perfect as it once was, and the switch doesn’t always work. The problem is that I am used to switching on the kettle, and then getting on with other things, knowing that when I return, there will be a kettle full of boiled water waiting, and that no water or electricity would have been wasted by the kettle staying on for to long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the switch doesn’t always work, and this has been happening for a while. From experience, I have noticed that the kettle only switches itself when I’m nearby, and waiting to switch it off. When I’m not there, it carries on boiling merrily. One could simply put this down as an example of Murphy’s Law, but I think one needs a more scientific approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying quantum mechanics to the situation, one realises that the kettle is both on and off until someone is watching it. As soon as I’m in the room, the two probability waves for the kettle collapse, and the kettle settles into its final state. In at least one universe, the kettle had been boiling the whole time, and that energy can’t just be forgotten. This means that if there is no observer, the water has to boil in at least one universe. If there is an observer, then there is no chance for multiple probability waves to form, so the water never boils in any universe (at least, not in any of my universes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I’m not a quantum physicist. I’m an engineer, so naturally, I think it’s got more to do with the collapsing reliability function of the kettle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6158785515678358340/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6158785515678358340&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6158785515678358340'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6158785515678358340'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/07/on-philosophers-part-ii.html' title='On Philosophers Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2987527914341170749</id><published>2009-07-19T19:35:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:23:45.100+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><title type='text'>On Humans and Monkeys</title><content type='html'>You hear people saying that humans are just hairless monkeys.

On the door, someone had placed a sign reading “Closed due to the account of the weather.” I understand that it is possible that the sign might have been referring only to the door, but the way it was written made it seem like the shop was closed.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Surely they would have put a "Come in" at the beginning, or at least specified that they were talking about the door and not the store. And the choice of wording may simply have been a case of bad grammar, but I prefer not to underestimate people’s intelligence like that. I am sure that the sign said exactly what they wanted it to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is that the store was closed due to the account of the weather. And this makes sense. In the present economic climate (don’t those words get used a lot nowadays), thousands of stores are closing due to their customers accounts, and bad debts. We are living in difficult times, and it would have been arrogant of me to assume that this particular store was immune to the economic collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a lot of cases, I don’t believe the stores are to blame. Everyone was allowing customers to buy on account, and it seemed to be working, so why not follow the sheep. This store, however, had no excuse. The weather is an obvious high risk customer. It is mentally unstable, has an uncontrollable rage, and frequently moves countries, usually without a passport. It also has no stable income, and is well known for numerous antisocial acts, ranging from simple vandalism through to outright destruction and mass homicide. Honestly, if a store is prepared to offer the weather an account, then they are just asking for bad debts. They deserve to have closed down.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6319988841130255220/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6319988841130255220&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6319988841130255220'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6319988841130255220'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/07/on-closed-doors.html' title='On Closed Doors'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5447226267307499434</id><published>2009-07-12T16:19:00.007+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.426+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Google'/><title type='text'>On Google, part VI</title><content type='html'>Google is an ingenious tool. It learns from the people who use it, and adapts to what they want. And most of the world’s internet users use Google. That makes Google the perfect tool for the average internet user to find information.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Google is designed specifically to make it as simple as possible for the average internet user to find information they want. It is a brilliant idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing Google did not take into account was that the internet is playing a bigger and bigger role in the lives of humans. The internet is now accessible, and average internet users are no longer smart geeks like 20 years ago. Now, the average internet user is just a normal human. This is unfortunate, because the global average for intelligence is pretty low. This means that Google makes information easy to find for idiots, and the minority who are serious and actually need useful information are left to dig through the mud for it. This, I suppose, is fair. The serious information seekers are more capable of digging than the average idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A feature Google used to include was a drop down list of previous searches. Which was stupid, because I either found what I was looking for and don’t need to search again; or I did not find anything, and need to try a different search. Google obviously realised this and replaced this feature. This new feature tries to guess what you are typing based on most the popular searches starting with the same letters. This is just a mirror into the mass stupidity of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My attention was drawn to this by a random picture I found listing the most popular searches starting with “I like to t…” The results are obviously hilarious: In the list, there were two that really caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“I like to think of Jesus as a mysterious badger”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“I like to tape my thumbs to my hands to see what it would be like to be a dinosaur”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Even more ridiculous are the searches starting with “why is there…” The results from Google South Africa are not that unusual, but if you go to Google.com, they get interesting. This time, I’ll give them all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there fuzz on a tennis ball"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there no j street in dc"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there a worm in tequila"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there daylight savings time"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there an apple on the cover of twilight"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there a leap year"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there something rather than nothing"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there air"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Why is there salt in the ocean"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bear in mind that these are the most popular searches.

There’s no denying that most normal people in this country don’t use public transport. Anyone who does use public transport either does not own a car or driver’s license, and cannot get a lift with anyone, or has something wrong with them, or is just abnormal.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I fall into the latter category, and because of this, I catch a bus on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catching a bus in South Africa is easier than most people think. It just takes patience. There are hundreds of bus routes in Johannesburg, and there are bus stops every couple of blocks. Once you find the route that goes where you want to go, and found one of the numerous bus stops on that route, it’s just a matter of waiting. I have a lot of patience, and so waiting is no problem for me. Unfortunately, I travel one of the less popular routes, so the buses going my way are slightly less common, and I often have to wait over an hour for a bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing with waiting is that most people don’t find it as easy as I do, and they assume that everyone has as little patience as they do. In order to avoid the wait, they arrive at the bus stop only when they expect the bus. There is one bus in particular that runs every half hour. The drivers of that route are reliable and punctual, and so the commuters of that route are particularly good at arriving at the bus stop exactly when the bus arrives. If the bus is not there, they seem to like asking those standing around if they have seen the bus. Last week, one of them asked me. I simply replied “Yes”. He replied with an OK, and left the bus stop. If he had waited five more seconds, I would have added “but that was thirty minutes ago”, but he simply assumed that I would not have the patience to wait that long. Within a minute, the bus he wanted came and left without him. It’s too bad that he got home half an hour later that day than he could have. He didn’t even need to be patient – he just had to realise that some other people in the world are. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8026611460551960086/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8026611460551960086&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8026611460551960086'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8026611460551960086'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/07/on-public-transport.html' title='On Public Transport'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1678713516809168217</id><published>2009-07-05T16:18:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T15:25:30.215+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Technology Part IV</title><content type='html'>Especially the technology that people use while driving.

At the time, I put the behaviour down to intelligence, but I should have realised that it all has to do with aerodynamics.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bring this up is because I saw a plastic bag trying to cross the road. (That is, I hope it wasn’t actually trying. I hope that there was merely a slight crosswind carrying it. I’d prefer to believe that plastic bags have not developed intelligence.) There was an almost solid stream of traffic, and the plastic bag was unable to cross. However, it still made as if to cross in front of each car, but quickly moved back. When there was finally a small gap in the traffic (due to the fact that I happened to be driving a bit slowly), the bag made a mad dash into the road, but slowed as it saw me approaching. Since I am slightly less concerned about the damage a plastic bag would do to my car (compared to that of, say, a peacock or person), my evasive actions were not particularly drastic. I did not slow down, and moved over only slightly. The plastic bag immediately jumped back onto the pavement out of my way. It’s interesting to note that that’s exactly the way people behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Why do we call the paved bit the road, and the unpaved bit the pavement? I believe that some foreigners refer to them the other way round. Where did the language get confused like that?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note: Do peacocks hibernate for the winter? I haven’t seen them in a while and I haven’t heard them squealing at night. It’s interesting to note that the peacock’s mating call sounds exactly like I’d imagine a three year old human would if he was dropped in a meat grinder.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3381093005543003965/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3381093005543003965&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3381093005543003965'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3381093005543003965'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/06/on-behaviour-of-peacocks-and-people-part-ii.html' title='On the Behaviour of Peacocks and People Part II: Plastic Bags'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8187616111388477788</id><published>2009-06-28T15:03:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:23:54.802+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weather'/><title type='text'>On Winter</title><content type='html'>The colder side of winter is definitely here. Its freezing (according to my standards, at least). Being slightly bored, I decided to apply my mind to the problem. The simple solution is that everyone in North and South America simultaneously move into their northernmost neighbour’s residence, and at exactly the same time, everyone in the rest of the world moves into their southernmost neighbour’s residence.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; This would change the axis of rotation of the Earth very slightly, effectively countering the movements that everyone made. The Americas would slowly begin to drift south, and the rest of the world would drift north, meaning that South Africa would get closer to the equator, and grow a bit warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being bored, I did all the necessary calculations to see what would happen. The movement of the world’s population would impart a total of more than thirty seven thousand Gigajoules of rotational kinetic energy to the Earth. Of course, people move all the time, but people move in random directions and the energies all cancel out. An orchestrated move will result in kinetic energy that is not cancelled out. (I estimated that the human population of the world is 388 billion kilograms. That’s a lot of mass to move...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may sound like a lot of energy, but it’s not really. The Earth itself weighs 15 trillion times more than the entire human population, so you have to look at this sort of thing in context. The energy is still enough to cause an angular rotation about an equatorial axis of about a trillionth of a radian per second (which for the non-engineers of the world, translates to a net northward motion of my house of about 3.7 metres a week). This does not sound like much, but within 2600 years, my house will be in the tropics. I’m not selfish, you see.

Sorry... I mean interesting, or... cool. Someone really needs come up with a word that doesn’t make a lame pun when used with polar bears. It’s a serious flaw in the English language. (A side note: when a horse becomes lame, they shoot it.) But, the fact still remains that polar bears are normally cool animals.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; How cool they are is a function of the time elapsed since their last meal, and whether or not they are facing you. The same goes for tigers. If you see a tiger, it’s probably better if it is watching something else, and that it keeps doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back on the topic of polar bears, I’ve always wondered what convinced polar bears to abandon the forests where bears normally live and move up into a region that has no trees, no plants, and is permanently covered with a layer of solid ice. Polar bears are big, and it’s never a good idea to put something really big on ice. And surely it was much easier to find food in the forests. And surely it was a bit warmer. And then people still think of polar bears as being wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polar bears chose to go north, over land, but the penguins moved south, over several thousand kilometers of ocean to Antarctica. Possibly it was to get away from the polar bears, but there is one important thing to note about the continent of Antarctica before one can jump to any conclusions. There are only two creatures that live on the land in Antarctica (Seals are stupid, so they don’t count). These are penguins and people. The only reason people are there is to conduct scientific research. The conclusion one can draw from this is that the penguins also only moved there to conduct scientific research. I’ve always said that penguins cannot be trusted.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4227779576732537441/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4227779576732537441&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4227779576732537441'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4227779576732537441'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/06/on-polar-bears.html' title='On Polar Bears'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7167903053577158874</id><published>2009-06-22T10:17:00.007+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T12:38:57.128+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Plagiarism</title><content type='html'>As a university student, one gets warned about plagiarism so many times, it starts to get annoying.

It wasn’t even my idea to steal the skunk in the first place, and I had nothing to do with the whole business. I don’t even think stealing animals is right. In fact I’m against the whole idea, and I don’t even know if the skunk was stolen, or if so, where they found it. This is just not the sort of thing I do.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please don’t ask me how the skunk was laying squirrel eggs. The truth is that I don’t know. In fact, I don’t think I want to know, and I’m not too sure why you would want to know anyway. And since I don’t think it matters, can we please leave that topic alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point that I wanted to make, and I don’t think I got it across in the last two paragraphs, unless you are far more perceptive than anyone could possible have imagined, is that there are no cattle living in my garage. There are no rodents living in my garage either (too the best of my knowledge), not that skunks are rodents. Yes squirrels are, but how is that relevant to my argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My argument, which seems to be growing less and less coherent with each word I type; but as you can see, the premises are really starting to build, which is not what counts. What counts is the conclusions you draw from the premise, but why would anyone want it to count. It has no way of sensing it’s environment, so counting is a skill it would never be able to put into practise, and even if it could count, being a set of typed characters, it would have no way to adjust itself to, and express the result it obtained. Much like the universe if you think about it. It’s just expanding, and contains so much information, but none of it is coherent. It’s taken several billion years to get where it is, and doesn’t look anywhere near ready to make its point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you’d have to squeeze the skunk. Skunks don’t just lay squirrel eggs naturally. You need to force them. I know squirrels don’t lay eggs either, but what has that got to do with the skunk. It’s just a futile effort by the human mind to bring more information into the problem, without trying to solve anything. It’s certainly human nature to try and complicate the solution to things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’ve gone and complicated it all so much that I can’t even remember what the problem that I started out with. It’s quite obvious that squirrels and skunks must have skunks must have made an appearance somewhere along the line, but I can’t work out where,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m just going to have to leave it there, without any point. If you want a point, its probably easiest to just use a pencil sharpener, but some people use a knife. I’ve always preferred to use clutch pencils, because then I just click a button to make the point. Its unfortunate for you that there is no button for me to click to make a point here, but that gives you a taste of what I have to live with every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I did manage to make a point, I’d have forgotten why it was necessary by the time I’d made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn Germans…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Squirrels are very high in cholesterol, and not exactly the healthiest food. However, some people in the UK apparently deliberately eat gray squirrels (an invasive species) in an attempt to save the red squirrels (the local squirrel). I found this so outrageous that I actually needed to give it a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07squirrel.html?_r=4&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s not that it’s not true, but rather that there is a lot of detail that is left out. The truth is that most cats will try to play with absolutely anything that moves, including mice, birds, cars, feet and interestingly enough, dogs.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; They don’t actively chase anything (although they will stalk and attack anything that is mildly interesting, including furniture). However, it is the second part of this belief that annoys me most. So many people believe that dogs chase cats, which is true, but only for a dog that has never had an encounter with a cat, and it is merely a result of the dog’s insatiable curiosity for new smells. In at least half of the cat-dog encounters I have ever seen, the dog has not chased the cat, but has rather approached cautiously with a slightly wagging tail, and then been hissed and spat at, and eventually scratched on the nose. After that, the dog will pretend to ignore any cat it encounters. It is unfortunate that all of this information cannot be conveyed in a simple three word statement, such as "Cats chase mice."&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3140559487596633780/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3140559487596633780&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3140559487596633780'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3140559487596633780'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/06/on-popular-myths.html' title='On Popular Myths'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4322216457184440375</id><published>2009-06-07T20:00:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T15:30:32.153+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><title type='text'>On Paper Folding</title><content type='html'>This person is almost as bad as I am...&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pomonahistorical.org/12times.htm"&gt;Folding Paper in Half 12 Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4322216457184440375/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4322216457184440375&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4322216457184440375'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4322216457184440375'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/06/on-paper-folding.html' title='On Paper Folding'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6029773065784362090</id><published>2009-06-07T16:38:00.008+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:16:12.396+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Google'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On Google and the Blue Monkey</title><content type='html'>Regular followers of my blog will know that I have a fascination with appearing in Google’s searches. As a person who spends a lot of time searching Google for scientific content, with in depth explanations. More technical than what a high school or first year student would be looking for. And I am almost always disappointed.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; (My fellow students will understand how useless Google actually is if you aren’t just an average bored person, or twelve year old with a project for school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I eventually worked out that there are far better ways to get quality information that is accurate and reliable, I decided that I’d feed those poor unfortunate Google users with the information they want. Please don’t misunderstand this. I am a nice person. I am not aiming to get onto Google searches just to be a pain in the neck. Where ever possible, I’d like to bring those ignorant people the information that they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google includes an extremely useful feature for web site owners, called “Google Webmaster Tools”. It allows users to see what Google searches return my blog in the results, and which of these actually led people to click a link to my blog. It is remarkably interesting how little information is on Google if you see the sorts of searches that will put me near the top of the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular is a search “blue monkey wikipedia” which returned my blog on the first page. Naturally, I was curious and did some research. The blue monkey (or diademed monkey) is in fact a silver and gray monkey that can be found in Eastern and Central Africa. It’s interesting that the vervet monkey which is very common in South Africa is called a blouapie in Afrikaans (translated literally as “blue monkey”). This is a completely different type of monkey. The truth is that neither monkey is actually blue, which just goes to reaffirm that biologists have no clue about the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another one that I am particularly proud of is that a search for “flapping flight” returns my blog as number 176 on the list. (I have not verified this.) The reason that I’m proud of it is that it’s a field I’m really interested in. If anyone really is interested in this from a scientific or engineering point of view, I refer you to the work of Ansari et.al. who seems to have the best mathematical model. They approximate the wing by a thin cambered Joukowsky airfoil, and use potential flow theory to model the unsteady flow over the wings. The analysis is extended into three dimensions by considering the vortex and wake interactions as the wings flap. He then uses a momentum based method to extract the forces and moments on the wings, and presents them in two neat little vector integral equations.

If they are possible, then they are almost certainly sterile and pointless. A half pig half sheep would be stupid idea. I think you should be far more worried about a half sheep half jaguar. They would look like fluffy white (very much) overgrown domestic cats, until you get too close, and they pounce on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that concerns me is that there really is such a thing as a blue potato.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6029773065784362090/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6029773065784362090&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6029773065784362090'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6029773065784362090'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/06/on-blue-monkey.html' title='On Google and the Blue Monkey'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3465834202629049843</id><published>2009-06-07T15:37:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-07T15:44:44.441+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Just for Reference</title><content type='html'>My stats, unrecorded due to a system fault, for the week of 1-7 June 2009.

With so much effort being put into the presentation of these plates, one can’t help but wonder if they were deliberately trying to attract people to them. Its difficult to resist the urge to walk up and help myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if the snacks were for the functions guests, they would have been put inside the actual venue, not left outside in the foyer.

In a desperate attempt to save the world, with an animal in plastic bag under each arm, and nothing else to put the chipmunk in, I’d be forced to grab the nearest peanut butter jar, eat it all in seconds and shove the chipmunk in. Anyone who has watched me walk in rain will notice that I tilt my head to the right (or probably not, since its not the sort of thing people look out for, but if they know to look out for it, they will see it). This makes balancing the peanut butter jar on my head impossible. I will be forced to balance it on my left earlobe. The thing that prevents me from learning this skill is that my sense of balance is a bit below average (for the same reasons that I tilt my head in the rain). In the meantime, I have been making every effort to stay out of Bangladesh during the monsoon season, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useful skill I have been able to learn is the ability to operate the bath taps with my feet. This means I have complete control over the water temperature without even having to lift a finger. Having been able to do this for most of my life, I began trying to use my feet for various other things. Not so successful attempts were made at operating the kettle and the stove, however the microwave was mildly successful (Luckily, it’s a digital one). Opening doors is easy, except for the garage door, which is on a step and used to be slightly out of my reach. Especially if there is a car parked next to it, preventing my leg from stretching to its full reach. With practice, I have been able to reach even that door easily in the last couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Please understand that I don’t do this all the time. It is far more efficient to use my hands to open doors, but if my hands are holding something heavy, it is far easier to use my foot to open the door than to put whatever it is down and pick it up again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two doors that force me to use my hands. The first is the bathroom. After a bath, the floor is often wet and slippery, and standing on one leg on a wet floor with a below average sense of balance is definitely not a smart idea. Anyway, I’m hardly ever carrying anything, so using my hands is the safest, simplest and most efficient option. The second type of door is a car door. The designers of most car doors do not think of feet. Barefoot I can usually manage to get the door open, but closing it is a mission. However, when I want to get into a car, I’ll typically be wearing shoes, which really makes it impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only my toes weren’t so clumsy, I’d also be playing the piano with my feet by now.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4188002318409344966/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4188002318409344966&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4188002318409344966'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4188002318409344966'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-balancing-galloping-chipmunks.html' title='On Balancing Galloping Chipmunks'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6372535650160063129</id><published>2009-05-31T14:45:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T15:34:16.467+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Google'/><title type='text'>On Google Part V - yet again...</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/intl/xx-piglatin/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs no comment...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6372535650160063129/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6372535650160063129&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6372535650160063129'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6372535650160063129'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-google-part-v-yet-again.html' title='On Google Part V - yet again...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6092542229342976809</id><published>2009-05-24T15:22:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:38:48.234+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mathematics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weather'/><title type='text'>On Winter Problems</title><content type='html'>It is winter, and the nights are getting colder. Actually the nights seem to be staying the same temperature, while the early hours of the morning seem to be getting freezing, which is what is causing the whole problem. After waking up too cold one morning, I decided that it was time for my winter duvet. So I dragged the massive down duvet (which weighs more than I do) from the top of the cupboard and replaced my flimsy summer duvet.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The problem is that evenings are still warm, and my duvet ensures that I am kept uncomfortably hot, and unable to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lying awake last night, my mind went wandering. Eventually it settled on something which I’d read, maybe six or seven years ago. Apparently, in a group of 50 people, the chance of two or more people having a birthday on the same day is around 97%. I found this slightly incredible, and my subconscious mind seemed to want verification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: Not a side note. Anyone not mathematically inclined may find themselves slightly lost in the rest of this post. You have been warned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set up a statistics problem in my head to calculate the probability of two or more people sharing a birthday in a sample size on n. Starting with the obvious, I set it clear in my mind that for n = 1, the probability is 0. For a sample size of 2, the probability would be 1 in 365.25 (to take leap years into account). For three people, the probability that the third person shares a birthday with either of the first two is added in. Eventually I came up with the nice simple equation of n*(n-1)/730.5. Unfortunately, this equation did not satisfy the obvious conditions from the other end. You’d expect the probability in a group of 366 people to be 100%. In fact, my formula gives 18000%. A slight overestimate. A little annoyed, I finally fell asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem returned to me this morning. Some vague recollection of the statistics course I did last year made me realise that the focus should not be on the probability of two people sharing a birthday, but rather on the probability of two people not sharing a birthday. This would make the probabilities multiplicative rather than additive, which would solve the whole problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meant that the probability of not sharing a birthday with anyone already in the group when the nth person is added is (1-(n-1)/365.25) multiplied by the probability for the rest of the group. That gave a nice iterative solution, but I don’t like iterative solutions (Actually I do. I love iterative solutions, but I also love it when something horribly complicated comes down to one simple formula). Wherever possible, I want a nice short equation that requires no understanding of advanced maths to solve. So I wrote down the iterative solution, and multiplied it out and got a simple expression involving factorials – the largest being 365!. So I pulled out my little scientific calculator, forgetting that it squeals when shown anything more than 70!. Since I happened to be sitting in front of a computer, I turned to that, and started Microsoft Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: If I’d been at home, I would have opened Python. If I’d been at university, I’d have opened Matlab. But I was at work, and Excel was the most powerful numerical computational tool I had available. Excel is limited, but has more power than most people give it credit for.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excel, however, was only mildly more powerful than my calculator, and pronounced its unintelligible death cry of “#NUM!” at 171!. With no tool more powerful, I had to think more broadly. I thought, “If I was some super genius, what would I do?”, and came up with an answer. I’d reprogram Excel. Unfortunately, I’m not a super genius and wouldn’t know where to begin. I’m only a moderately smarter than an average genius, and had to settle for creating a whole new technique for handling very, very large numbers. Luckily, I was saved the trouble by whoever it was that invented scientific notation. Using this principle, I set up a simple algorithm for finding the factorial of really large numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realise I only needed the algorithm to work up to 365!, but I do have a tendency to overdo this sort of thing. Limited only by the 65536 rows available in Excel I set out to prove that I could not be defeated. Upon reaching the end, and finding that 65535! is in fact 7.878034e287 188 (A number almost 300 000 digits long), I realised that there were 256 columns available, and I’d only used 7. Laughing, I started the algorithm with 65536 in column H, and double clicked the little black box to copy the cell contents to the bottom of the spreadsheet. The computer laughed back as its RAM was used up. It is incredible annoying how the computer just displays a white screen and refuses to do anything. The nice thing is that when it does finally give you a message, it allows you to drag the message over the screen, and doesn’t refresh anything behind it, which lets you get rather fascinating patterns, depending on how quickly you can drag the message box..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I worked out a way past the RAM limitations of the computer and was driven by an overwhelming desire to find out when my algorithm would cease to work.. So I copied the algorithm all the way to column IR and created a spreadsheet that took several minutes to process a save request (and produced a 499 MB file). I finally found that 2 359 260! is 1.073258e14 010 425 (that’s a 14 million digit number). I hate it when I overdo things like this, but I’m always driven by curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So driven in fact, that I typed exactly 1000 words on it, and forgot completely about the probability of people sharing birthdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6092542229342976809/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6092542229342976809&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6092542229342976809'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6092542229342976809'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-winter-problems.html' title='On Winter Problems'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2719226465993621060</id><published>2009-05-24T14:50:00.008+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:00:21.744+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Functional Structure of a Pen</title><content type='html'>One of the biggest downfalls of the modern design of the pen is that more than two thirds of the pen sticks out of your hand when you use it.

Any structure that does not carry out a function that is absolutely critical to the safe operation of the aircraft is left out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to apply my engineering knowledge to make modifications to a pen, in order to eliminate some of the useless components.

My other pocket contains a bunch of keys and a cell phone.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; All of these are items which would be picked up, even just slightly by the metal detector. They all set off alarms at the airport (especially my shoes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why then do they not make a sound half the time? The obvious reason is that they are not always switched on. It’s quite hilarious to watch a security guard with a serious expression on his face scan you with his little metal detector, which is not even turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pass through one of these checkpoints at work every week. I make sure I carry as many bags as possible, and ask him, “Are you sure you don’t want to check the side compartments too?” It annoys the people behind me, but I’m thinking of sneaking a piece of steel pipe past them one day to see how easy it is.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3063854623189792850/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3063854623189792850&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3063854623189792850'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3063854623189792850'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-security-check-points.html' title='On Security Check Points'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8080054679369882598</id><published>2009-05-17T16:16:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-03T15:03:05.225+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='doors'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='annoying things'/><title type='text'>On Automatic Doors...</title><content type='html'>...

As much as I try, I can’t help but follow the patterns of the bricks or colours on the floor. This is especially annoying if a dark stripe follows the edge of the passageway. I am compelled to follow it, and it brings me to approach the door from an angle that only brings me into range of the sensor as I am immediately at the door.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I then have to wait as the door opens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also enough evidence to conclude that they have sound detectors. Very sensitive sound detectors and all the voice recognition and interpretation software that can go with.

I have watched it open for other people, and I’m sure that both its response time and speed are quicker than for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, whenever I encounter a new door, I smile and greet it politely.

It is a terrible problem. You wouldn’t have noticed it, unless you were a cat. Even the cats are only mildly annoyed with it, since those polystyrene packaging things don’t hurt at all when you are hit by them.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you wonder why anyone would want to laminate a plastic chair? Or where you can buy them? Probably not. You were too busy thinking of the whole thing, and didn’t let each concept sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: I bet the word random came into your mind, and if it did, then you would have been wrong. There is no such thing as ‘random’. We have to use pseudo-random, which means carefully chosen, calculated based on a set of extremely complex and highly linked set of rules that make the output so difficult to accurately determine, that it becomes unpredictable by any practical means. Whenever I roll a dice, I try to construct Newton’s laws, and set up a system of differential equations. The problem is that I can never seem to differentiate the trajectory of the roller’s hand precisely enough to get an accurate measure of the imparted velocity, and I have no idea of the Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the damned dice, so I can never get a good idea of the deformation as it hits the surface – which would allow me to work out the exact trajectory as it bounces. My eye is also a poor judge of surface quality, so I have no idea of the microscopic imperfections that would affect the rebound of the dice, and the weight imbalance from the markings throws me off a bit. The gravity variation as the dice changes height is easy to work out, but by the time it takes me to model the aerodynamic forces on a three dimensional rolling cube, the dice has already been lying still for several hours. It’s difficult to predict, yes, but I could still work it out. Nothing is random. Some quantum physicists may argue, but they poison cats for a living... Why would you trust them? This blog post is not random at all. I really prefer the term “arbitrarily chosen”, which mathematicians like to use instead of “carefully chosen after 6 weeks of sleepless nights and several thousand pages of failed calculations, in order to reveal a single slightly interesting, but mostly pointless phenomena”.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’m trying to get across here is that there is a plot by penguins to agitate domestic cats into attacking furniture (since the laminated plastic chairs are claw proof, they’ll have to take out their frustrations on expensive leather sofas and polished wooden tables, and the TV stand.) This will cause an outrage with trees and cows, whose dreams are being shattered. (Their best aspiration has just been turned to a scratch post. The next best thing for a cow is to become a MacDonald’s burger...) This will cause a trees and cows to revolt, destroying the world, and the penguins will walk in and take over, completely blameless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The penguins are there... spying on you. If you don’t believe me, refer to the plot in Figure 1 below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SgcTHt-YYdI/AAAAAAAAABE/ESsysIr0XPU/s1600-h/Penguin.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SgcTHt-YYdI/AAAAAAAAABE/ESsysIr0XPU/s400/Penguin.JPG"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Figure 1: Variation of visible penguin populations with time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is apparent that penguins are disappearing, and yet the number of visible penguins in your house remains constant at zero. Where do the remaining penguins go? Invisible penguins in your house... And we don’t know what the initial population of penguins was, so the number of invisible penguins could be anything from a few thousand to several billion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I’m not even getting into the rabies side of things... Not to mention the hairy armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, my mind breaks down the little concepts so much, I start scaring myself.

Whenever you take a dog for a walk, it will always pull ahead, as if it knows where you are going. The thing is, you need to vary the routes, to keep things interesting, and the dog knows this. It will always map its own route in its mind, and then try to lead you along it.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The result is that the dog and leash form a vector, aligned with the dogs path, but following yours. This leads to the dog walking along diagonally next to the owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: This only happens if you are lucky enough to own a small to medium sized dog. Things work a bit differently owners of big dogs. In general, the owner gets dragged face down on the ground along the dog’s route, and is given ten seconds to stand up every time the dog finds an interesting tree.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this is undeniable proof that dogs are mathematically superior than humans. The dog knows where it wants to be – somewhere on the other side of the road – and it has plotted all possible routes to get there. In it’s mind, it has calculated the efficiency of all routes, and worked out that walking diagonally is, of course, 41.4% more efficient than just crossing the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1372036698472452295/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1372036698472452295&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1372036698472452295'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1372036698472452295'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-diagonally-walking-dogs.html' title='On Diagonally Walking Dogs.'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5960833393502381319</id><published>2009-05-03T18:41:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:02:43.308+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Flying Monkey Dog...</title><content type='html'>... which launches rockets from it's armpits, and secretes vanilla ice cream from it's elbows.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Consider it in your mind.

This has nothing to do with "Aliens Stole My Husband's Skin", or anything of that nature, but it does have to do with other stories. Two stories in particular, from a certain newspaper (I’m not going to mention names, but they are one of two that prefer to print their advertisements with white writing on a black background, and not the one that reports on finance).&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Actually, this has little to do with the stories themselves (since I did not actually read them), but has more to do with the headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first read “Toilet Swallows Pupil”. This is rather alarming, and I sincerely hope that this is an isolated incident and that authorities have securely locked up the offending toilet. I was not aware that toilets had evolved dietary requirements. Luckily, toilets are usually firmly cemented into the ground, and must therefore wait for some unsuspecting prey to wonder into its open jaws. I’m sure that if everyone simply avoided using all toilets, then the toilets which have nutritional needs will starve, and eventually die out. I just pray that I did not miss the headline which read “Toilet Learns to Walk”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second headline read “My Dog is a … Sheep.” I have no idea what the actual content of the article was, but it lead me to a search. In April 2007 in Japan, a company called “Poodles as Pets” was shut down, allegedly for selling sheep as poodles. Apparently, sheep are half the price of poodles, and Japanese people, who are not familiar with sheep, were easy to deceive. Suspicions grew when people began to notice that their “dogs” were not barking or eating dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1457010010723042156/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1457010010723042156&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1457010010723042156'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1457010010723042156'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-aliens-stole-my-husbands-skin-and.html' title='On &quot;Aliens Stole My Husband&apos;s Skin&quot; and Other Stories'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7489096787107221324</id><published>2009-04-29T11:04:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-13T07:35:33.076+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Very Little, Actually</title><content type='html'>Because there's not much to say.

English no longer has a gender-neutral singular reference pronoun. Until a few years ago, this role was taken up the word ‘he’, as in “Anyone can do what he wants.”&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Now, the meaning of ‘he’ has been limited to male only. The need to constantly replace ‘he’ with the extremely clumsy ‘he or she’ led to the use of the multiple reference, but gender-neutral pronoun ‘they’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not technically correct, as the statement “Anyone can do what they want” implies multiple subjects. This would lead to the more important singular generalization pronouns ‘anyone’, ‘everybody’ and ‘someone’, amongst others, to become multiple generalization pronouns. This means that anyone who asks for something would in fact be several people asking for lots of that thing, and life would suddenly get a lot more confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much simpler if singular and plural are kept separate, and a new gender-neutral singular reference pronoun is introduced. I propose the phrase ‘gender-neutral singular reference’ to prevent further confusion.

But that's not important, even though I did introduce it as so.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The important thing is that they need to be rolled through mud first. Rolled through as thoroughly as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud covering is for camouflage, and it is one of the best there is. Think about it. You have absolutely no chance of identifying a mud covered chimpanzee in an army of mud covered chimpanzees. They will be invisible… Those South American countries won’t even know what has hit them until it’s too late. And even then, they will only understand half of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because if they can’t spot an entire army of mud-covered chimpanzees, then what chance do they stand of seeing the three tortoises that sneak in from the side. Midget tortoises armed with balls of socks and slices of moldy cheese.

The problem is that I eat the same thing for breakfast every single day, and I’m really bored of it. I’ve tried alternating a few things, but when you look at it, all breakfasts are the same.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It’s all either cereals or porridge, since I really don’t have the time to fry bacon and eggs. All porridges are the same, and cereals always go soggy, and after that, they always taste the same. Coco Pops are awesome for the first month or so, but after that, they're just soggy Rice Crispies in overly sweet slightly chocolate flavoured milk. The problem is that if I skip breakfast, I start really craving lunch at nine 'o clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The argument for breakfast being important is that it is necessary to fill up after 12 hours or so of no food. My philosophy is that it is probably better to fill up at dinner time, since you know your next meal is going to be a long way away. It all depends on whether you are the type to make sure there is enough petrol for the trip, or the type who is happy to push the car the last few kilometers to the petrol station to fill up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole issue got me wondering how animals manage. My dog gets fed exactly the same thing every day, twice a day, and has been for years. No wonder she ignores the food in her bowl and waits at the dinner table for our leftovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an even worse situation are cows, which can only eat the leaves of grass. And pandas, who can only the shoots of certain species of bamboo plants. I really need to introduce them to steak and potato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/54673082307709117/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=54673082307709117&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/54673082307709117'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/54673082307709117'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-boring-breakfasts.html' title='On Boring Breakfasts'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1254925965512823022</id><published>2009-04-19T16:45:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.432+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On Reflections</title><content type='html'>From and early age, we are all raised to believe that mirrors switch left and right. Then, later on in life, you are trying to flatten a stubborn hair that refuses to stay down. You stand in front of the mirror, raise your hand to your head, and then check the location of your hand relative to the hair. In the mirror, you note that the hair is to the right of your hand, so you need to move your hand to the right.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; However, because of all of the brainwashing you have had to undergo, your mind is convinced that the mirror is switching left and right. You send the signal to your hand to move toward the hair, but somewhere along the way, the signal is switched and your hand moves left – away from the hair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only people hadn’t lied to you for you're whole life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that most people genuinely believe that the mirror does switch reality around. I find this really strange because practically everyone looks at a mirror more than once or twice a day. It’s extremely disconcerting that so few people have noticed that if you raise your right arm, the reflection in the mirror also raises the arm on the right. It is such a simple concept, and I have no idea why so many people don’t understand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it never occur to them to wonder why it did not switch the top and bottom as well?&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1254925965512823022/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1254925965512823022&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1254925965512823022'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1254925965512823022'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-reflections.html' title='On Reflections'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-329223070884998999</id><published>2009-04-19T16:33:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:39:31.787+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On the Generally Inconsiderate Behaviour of Birds</title><content type='html'>It’s probably not intentional, and possibly because they go to the trees to do it, and because the shade tends to be under trees, rather than out in the sun.

With a very good sense of direction, and the ability to read a map, I have never had any need for one.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Last week, however, I had my first GPS experience. When the road forked, the GPS did not say which road to take until after the fork. This was just a minor inconvenience. So was the fact that it tells you to turn right when there is a concrete barrier and buildings in that direction. What was a problem is the fact that it had no clue where it was or where it was going. Instead of giving directions, it felt the need to constantly remind everyone that its signal was too low. The first time it did this, it was overcast, so it could be forgiven for not being able to reach the satellite network. The rest of the time, it was sunny and still had no idea where it was. However, it still had the cheek to shout out directions to some place 30 km from our actual destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has to deal with a GPS on a regular basis has my deepest sympathy...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4660375237306569168/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4660375237306569168&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4660375237306569168'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4660375237306569168'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-learning-to-use-technology-part-iii.html' title='On Learning to Use Technology: Part III'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4319878840061110871</id><published>2009-04-15T16:26:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:39:03.532+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Germans'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Unexpected Consequences</title><content type='html'>I was eating in a restaurant one night.

In the centre of the floor, and growing up through a hole in the roof, there is a massive tree (which is probably half a century older than the restaurant itself). I have no idea what type of tree it is, but it is covered in fairly large, and very sharp thorns. I could see that they were very sharp without getting up from my table ten metres away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone at another table (in his defence, he had possibly had a few drinks) stood up, walked over the tree and put his hand on it to test if the thorns were sharp.

Recently, someone Googled "what does giant rabbits eat", which for some reason, returned this blog as number two on the list. The worst thing is that he was from the United Kingdom - the supposed home of the English language.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite interesting that he focuses on giant rabbits, since this actually seems to be quite a popular search topic. One in particular simply asked Google "do giant rabbits actually exist"? The fact that this blog was Google's best answer just goes to show that the internet does not have the answer to every question. Or perhaps it does, but so many people think of Google as some person who knows everything, who sits in front of a computer all the time and lists out web sites containing the answers to any question you might care to ask. The truth is that Google only knows what I tell it (or what people like me tell it), and if I lie to Google, then Google will lie to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer the questions people might have about giant rabbits, they do exist. And they eat exactly what any other rabbits eat - grass, leaves and rabbit pellets - just in larger quantities than a conventional rabbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breeds of giant rabbit recognised by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) include the Checkered Giant, the Giant Chinchilla, the Flemish Giant, and German Grey Rabbits. There is also a British Giant, however ARBA does not accept this as a genuine rabbit breed because it is uncommon in the US. And of course, anything that is uncommon in America is uncommon full stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another search was "sheep and pig can be together" written all in capitals. A rather bold statement, and I don't think its true. I don't think that sheep are aggressive towards pigs, however sheep evolved on rocky mountains and open fields - while pigs evolved in dense forests. The two would never encounter each other in the wild, and would therefore have no need to be together in captivity. Anyway, sheep need lots of space with soft ground with lots of lush grass, while pigs prefer close surroundings and ground from which dust can easily be kicked up. There is no problem with keeping them together, but one of them would definitely not be happy. Why would you want to keep them together anyway?&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/8547250595350151671/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=8547250595350151671&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8547250595350151671'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/8547250595350151671'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-google-searches-part-ii.html' title='On Google Searches: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-9160770314832114512</id><published>2009-04-15T14:42:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:04:18.468+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On the Invention and Discovery of Bread: Part II</title><content type='html'>Walking through a shopping centre the other day, I saw an advertising display for a new product.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It consisted of a tower of crates containing loaves of bread.

It does not matter what order they take place in, but both must take place for anything to be useful. In the case of bread, I am absolutely certain that it was invented before it was discovered. Some things can be discovered long before they are invented. In fact, most things are.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Aeroplanes, for example, had existed in people’s imaginations for possibly thousands of years before they were actually built. Bread did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone in that age, when no one even understood simple concepts like wheels, and when no one had yet thought of sharpening rocks (you had to find one that was already sharp), to have thought up bread would have been completely amazing. Have you ever looked at a field of grain and thought, “These are quite tasteless, but if I picked just the seeds of several thousand of these plants; then crushed them really fine, mixed them with just the right amount of water, and then put it just the right distance away from the glowing embers of a dead fires, and then kept those embers at exactly the right temperature for the right amount of time; then I would have the perfect thing to put my lunch between so that I can hold it together more easily.” It would require unbelievable genius to make this leap. It is far more likely that someone just happened to mix in the right amount of water to make dough, and then forgot it by a dying fire for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only conceivable scenario that I could think of that would lead to us eating bread is that the accidental baker’s child picked up the forgotten loaf, and began to eat it. It must have been his son, because boy’s are more likely to actually eat something they found lying on the floor (girls just chew things), and he must have been four or older, because a younger child would not have indicated to the parent that it actually tasted good. The parent would then have tasted a small piece; decided that it tasted bland, and decided that that evening’s dinner should be served on it. Of course, any four year old boy given a slice of bread with something on would fold it in half, thereby inventing the sandwich.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3944388095510519895/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3944388095510519895&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3944388095510519895'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3944388095510519895'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-invention-and-discovery-of-bread.html' title='On the Invention and Discovery of Bread'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4337730231589115618</id><published>2009-04-05T12:08:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:39:11.889+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jokes'/><title type='text'>On Pointless Promises</title><content type='html'>Do you know what's really funny?

And as far as I know, it is impossible for a sandwich to know something. This means that all sandwiches are lost, even if you know where they are. In order to know something about the future, especially to understand a concept as complex as a destination, requires being able to sense the environment, and adapt to it.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; This is the basic principle behind any control system. One of the requirements for being lost is to have a destination, but to not know where it is in relation to one's self. Is it possible for the sandwich to feel this way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to be lost, the concept needs two things: the ability to store information in a stable manner and an ability to record its position. At first thought, this seems impossible, but it definitely requires further investigation. Bacteria live on almost everything you can put on a sandwich, which provides the sandwich with some form of (very simple) consciousness. Bacteria are able to pick up small bits of information and store some of it, but I doubt that a single bacterium is able to grasp a concept as advanced as a destination. However, large numbers of bacteria just might be able to. There have been studies into the ability of bacteria to interact and have an "emergent group consciousness".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all means that a sandwich just might be able to have a concept of a destination, and know where it is relative to its destination. The fact remains that it still has no means to propel itself towards that destination, and has to rely on carriers. The sandwich has no means of controlling its carrier’s route (I hope). Unless the primitive minds of sandwiches are a lot smarter than I am (which is a very scary thought), they have no way of working out how to get to their destinations. This amounts to not knowing how to reach the destination, which essentially amounts to the same as being lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: all sandwiches are always lost, no matter how you look at the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/6754387440169618002/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=6754387440169618002&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6754387440169618002'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6754387440169618002'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-lost-sandwiches.html' title='On Lost Sandwiches'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8229977731876615013</id><published>2009-03-29T12:43:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:06:10.084+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>On Learning to Use Technology: Part II</title><content type='html'>I've written before about people who buy GPS systems for their cars.

I don't know everything, but I do try. Anyway, here are the answers in case you couldn't find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you call wood ants could be termites (if they are white with 2 body segments). In this case, they are most definitely destructive. They could also be carpenter ants (3 body segments) which usually don't target healthy structures. In both cases, if they have nested in the walls of your house, they will be small holes in the walls with sawdust lying around. Termites also leave a bit of mud around the holes. If there are winged insects crawling out of the holes, this is a sure sign of a mature infestation - it's time to look for a new house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All ants are destructive to a certain degree. It depends on whether you are looking at it from a leaf or a mountain perspective. I assume you are worried about your home? I have no idea if ants have ever destroyed a brick house, but wooden houses have been destroyed by ants before. You should probably be more worried about a termite problem. Read what I discussed previously. If you really don't know, you should call in a pest control expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cross between a pig and a donkey would be sterile, stupid and pointless. I also don't see the point in it. All the good characteristics of both will be lost. It would be too fat and have stubby legs, so it wouldn't be able to pull a cart, and its meat would go all stringy and tough. Can you imagine donkey flavoured bacon? Is this pig wearing a funny hat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your rabbit is not eating salad then there are three possibilities. Perhaps the rabbit is not satisfied with the way you prepare the salad, or the rabbit is bored of salad and wants something else. Or the rabbit is sick. Either way, this is your rabbit we are talking about, not a broken toy. It is a living creature, and you should take it to the vet, not just Google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never heard of a bird that tends to sheep, however, there is a South American bird called the Southern Screamer that is trained to guard farms (because it screams really loud). It is also known as a Crested Screamer or Shepherd Bird.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/1833126261898830533/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=1833126261898830533&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1833126261898830533'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/1833126261898830533'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-google-searches.html' title='On Google Searches'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-5533048111163618054</id><published>2009-03-27T14:15:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:10:52.804+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='those damn penguins'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Germans'/><title type='text'>On Germans and the Portuguese</title><content type='html'>You really can blame them for everything. The same goes for Nigerians in this country. Every time something goes wrong, someone involved either knows a German, or knows someone who knows a German, or has seen a German somewhere, or has heard of a German, or knows someone who has heard of a German. Next time things don't go your way, think about it, and you will see that it is always has something to do with Germans.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same can be said about penguins, but penguins are secretive about where they are from. Ask a German where he/she is from, and you will be told that he/she is from Germany (or some place in Germany, or near Germany). Ask a penguin the same question, and you will get anything from blank looks to being ignored completely. The reason for this is that the penguins know that if they went round telling everyone that they are penguins, then people will start noticing them everywhere. When last did you see a penguin in the shops. You don't see them because you don't know they are penguins. If you do meet a penguin, and realise that it is a penguin, don't trust it. There is definitely some reason that it has revealed its identity to you.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5533048111163618054/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5533048111163618054&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5533048111163618054'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5533048111163618054'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-germans-and-portuguese.html' title='On Germans and the Portuguese'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4706301773383701318</id><published>2009-03-27T13:55:00.009+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.441+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On Unfair Victimisation</title><content type='html'>Rioters the other day were complaining of unfair victimisation from the police.

Not an ape that is in need of extra starch and not prepared to pay for it, but rather a vegetable that has the compulsive urge to slip extremely rare primates under its coat as it walks past. You can normally tell these potatoes from other potatoes, because most potatoes do not wear coats... Or walk past blue monkeys.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; If you do see a potato walking past blue monkeys, you should definitely be suspicious. However, if one happens to land up fried on your plate, it is probably safe to eat it. There is no evidence of anyone having died from eating a blue-monkey-stealing potato. But people have died from eating normal potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I apologise for the boring factual nature of the following paragraph, but it is necessary for me to make my point...) Because, in fact, all potato plants are poisonous. The dark green fruit is the most toxic part of the plant, but it only really contains seeds, so no one would want to eat it anyway. The leaves and stem are also quite poisonous. Even the root (which we eat) is slightly toxic. While not usually deadly, potato poisoning can cause headaches, diarrhoea, cramps, or comas. Luckily, the more toxic the potato, the greener it is, and cooking the potato partially breaks down the toxic chemicals. This is the reason that the potato gets whiter as it cooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a quite pointless side note: Apparently, Belarus is the highest per capita consumer of potato in the world, with each person eating almost 930 grams of potato a day. Someone should probably sell them some cows so they have something to eat with it. Of course, my source is the good old unverified Wikipedia, so who knows if it's true. Either way, its a lot of potato.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who was the one who decided "This fruit is poisonous, so I'll eat the root instead"? And even further along the line, someone thought, "Maybe this will be less poisonous if I chop it up and fry it." Did they try it themselves first, or did they get their friends to try it first? Is that really ethically correct? However it happened, I'm grateful for it. I really really like potato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it might all just be a scam by penguins to bring down the outstanding reputation of the potato. They are always doing things like that. Although the majority of penguins only have good intentions, there are always those that are out to ruin things for everyone else.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/614217039077777444/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=614217039077777444&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/614217039077777444'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/614217039077777444'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-blue-monkey-stealing-potato.html' title='On the Blue Monkey Stealing Potato'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-472138054408436245</id><published>2009-03-18T17:25:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-07T15:54:44.153+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fashion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><title type='text'>On Fashion</title><content type='html'>The other day, a group of friends and I saw a guy walk past wearing really tight bright red pants.

After a bit of thought I realised that he might be a really great person.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; It is possible that in the morning, he had seen a kitten being savaged by a giant mutated sea frog with evil intentions. The guy might have jumped immediately to the rescue, and ripped off the head of the monster. The resulting spray of blood might have stained his pants red, and caused them to shrink. Because of the delay, he might have had time only to change his shirt and wash his hands and face, but there was not enough to time to change his pants, and he was forced to wear the stained pants for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw him again this morning. He was wearing orange pants this time. I really feel sorry for him. He probably spent half the night fighting off an enraged flock of orange-blooded flying squids to protect a wounded puppy.

It's not because I can't throw (or more correctly, only partly), but more because sheep are badly designed. The first major issue is that they are difficult to hold. The sheep's body has nowhere that allows a good grip to be maintained while still allowing room for a decent swing.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The sheep has four legs, which allows for two people to swing it between them and cover a reasonable distance. However, there is not always an assistant available, and when trying to swing a sheep by the legs alone, one finds that the two free legs tend to get in the way, making the throw awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the issue of weight. Sheep can be quite heavy, which means that you need a lot of force to get a decent launch speed. There is also the problems of aerodynamics and stability. In flight, sheep tend to roll around, and it is difficult to get the sheep to land in the any specific position. The woolly coat is uneven and a symmetrical, leading to a significant drag increase, as well as a steady sidewards force. Together with the constant turning in flight, this can really mess up the planned trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two possible solutions to this problem. The first is to make some modifications to the sheep. Choose a smallish sheep, and strap two legs to it's body (for best results, do this to one front leg and one back leg). To save time, you may wish to choose a three (or even two) legged sheep, if you can find it. Then wrap the sheep in insulation tape, being careful to ensure that the sheep is symmetrical. You may wish to brace the neck, as the sheep tends to try look around, and this can lead to a very unstable flight. To the tail, attack some stabilising fins. Hold the sheep by the two free legs, give it a few good swings, and release it when near the top of it's arc. With practice, you may be able to get the sheep 50% further than a conventional sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second option is to review the projictile selection process. Sheep may have been a bad choice of animal to toss in the first place. Chickens, which are significantly lighter than sheep and have two legs, make remarkably good projectiles, provided you tie their wings back (flapping wings tends to lead to an inaccurate toss). Rabbits fly especially far, possibly due to the additional stability provided by their ears. (This point may be disputed, since the ears seem to add nothing to a donkey's flight)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/9139596458569272424/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=9139596458569272424&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9139596458569272424'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9139596458569272424'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-tossing-sheep.html' title='On Tossing Sheep'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8133871741885555449</id><published>2009-03-11T16:11:00.007+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:17:53.275+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tuna'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On the Behaviour of Peacocks and People</title><content type='html'>One of my neighbours decided, for some unknown reason, that it would be a good idea to have some peacocks. Peacocks are strange creatures. In their natural (domestic) environment, they have only one natural predator - the cat. But the peacock is a big bird, with a sharp beak and a long neck, and a cat will think twice before taking it on.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; They have two threats, that I would not classify as predators. A dog will not really actively hunt a peacock, but if a dog were to encounter one, it may try chase it, either for the fun of the chase, or to chew on it. However, dogs generally don't climb walls like cats and cannot reach the peacocks. The second threat is the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a peacock comes to a road and needs to cross, it just walks. It does not check to see if a car is coming (or even listen). It walks, and it takes its time about it. The interesting thing is if a car arrives, the peacock stops walking and stares. As I was leaving home one morning I encountered the peacocks. There used to be three, but they have apparently had chicks (if that's what you call baby peacocks) because there seem to be hundreds of them now. Three were waiting at the side of the road, and as I approached (at about 40 km/h, because they often do this) one decided to cross in front of me. I stopped, and so did it. It stood there staring. Eventually, it decided to continue again. As soon as it started walking, one of the others started to drift across. After both had finished crossing, I checked where the third one was. It was facing away from the road and showed absolutely no intention of crossing the road. As soon as I began to pull of, it turned and dashed in front of the car. I stopped and waited as it crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I explained the whole event in detail is because, about fifteen minutes later, exactly the same thing happened, only this time they weren't peacocks - they were people. And their behaviour and reaction to the car was identical to the peacocks. I've always considered peacocks to be very stupid, even as far as birds go, and even stupid people to be far smarter than the smartest of peacocks.

Like a set of car keys and a wallet. Or the house keys and sunglasses. They look different when you look properly, but if you don't think about it carefully, you can't tell the difference. You may not believe me, but it's true. Yesterday, when I got home from work, I put my car keys and house keys on the table, and then went to put my sunglasses and wallet away. Later in the evening, I went to put away the car keys.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; On the table I found my wallet and sunglasses, which I distinctly remembered having just put away, and no car keys. The house keys were missing as well. Being as lazy as I am, I decided to postpone the whole issue. I went to put my wallet and sunglasses away (for the second time), but when I opened the cupboard and put it down, my car keys were there, but my house keys were not. I looked towards where my sunglasses should have been, and found the house keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To confuse objects like this, it is only reasonable to assume that they are similar. Maybe not in appearance, but definitely in terms of weight. If you work out the percentage by which my wallet (which is really light at the moment) needed to increase in weight in order to be within 5% of the weight of my car keys, you can easily calculate what velocity I needed to be travelling in order for relativistic effects to increase the weight. Turns out (based on really, really rough head calculations and vague estimates), I must have been moving at 20 to 40% of the speed of light. And they all said I would never make it at athletics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either that or the penguins are messing with my head again. I haven't seen any evidence of them yet, but they could easily have perfected some advanced stealth technique. I don't know if anyone has a secret training project to develop penguin assassins. Well, maybe not training assassins (because I am apparently still alive), but possibly training penguins to switch objects in peoples homes. I don't see the point in this, but I don't see the point in politics either, and that most definitely does exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: You may not think this practice of rough calculations and vague estimates is a very reliable method, but that's actually what engineering is all about. Have you ever wondered why your doorway is as wide as it is, or why your ceiling is as wide as it is, or why your car windscreen is at the angle it is. It's all because someone sucked on their thumb and pulled out a "reasonable" number.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5149041668937853789/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5149041668937853789&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5149041668937853789'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5149041668937853789'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-similar-objects.html' title='On Similar Objects...'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4286671989202209926</id><published>2009-03-08T12:07:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.456+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='restaurants'/><title type='text'>On Simple Concepts</title><content type='html'>I was in a restaurant with my parents the other day.

Since the ony thing around are farms, I assumed that it was the farmers. However, I have recently seen a picture of one of these lines of trees, and immediately in front of the trees was a herd of cattle. Of course, the cattle were not actually planting the trees, they were standing around aimlessly, doing absolutely nothing.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; I have come to the conclusion, that upon noticeing the camera man, one of them sent some sort of signal to the others, and they all stopped what they were doing, and acted all innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cows are the most suspicious creatures, because whenever you encounter them, they are either on their way somewhere, or standing pretending to do nothing. If you return to your car in a parking lot, and there are no other cars in the immediate vicinity of yours, but there is a crowd of people standing next to your car, looking at you expectantly, your mind will instantly ask "What have they done?" It is the same with the cows, however they have such an innocent look about them that it takes a long time to realise how suspicious they actually look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking back to when I was travelling through the Free State, I remember that several of the lines of trees were next to fields of cows... or sheep, now that I think of it. In future, I will think twice before trusting livestock with anything... They thing I need to work out now is why they do it, and why they are so secretive about it.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5559538538601125662/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5559538538601125662&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5559538538601125662'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5559538538601125662'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-farmers-part-ii-devious-bovine.html' title='On Farmers Part II: Devious Bovine'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-7624728553845648881</id><published>2009-03-08T11:53:00.007+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.458+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On the Production of Chicken</title><content type='html'>&lt;img style="padding: 5px; float: left;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SbO7ZjlJxDI/AAAAAAAAAAk/qubhIoYSoKo/s400/n717903991_1096133_8238.jpg"/&gt;When I started this blog, I decided I was not going to put in any pictures, mainly because I'm too lazy to be bothered. But this time, I couldn't care less about enforcing my own rule. It's a stupid rule anyway, so I put a picture in anyway.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also promised myself that I would never target any specific person or group of people, or place or people from a place, but that's a bit of a stupid rule too. I've already targeted stupid children, and they're a group of people too (albeit a big group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, we all know that KFC does torture their chickens. That's what makes KFC so much juicier and tender than anyone else's... But it's OK, because the chickens aren't really alive. KFC has genetically engineered their chickens to such an extent that they now grow strings of featherless chicken pieces, already crumbed and ready to be fried. Who cares if they beat a couple of lifeless wings and thighs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just joking... On the more serious side of things, KFC don't actually farm chickens. They sell fast food, which is a completely different business to farming. Another one people often mix up is Woolworths. Woolworths does not make everything they sell themselves, nor is it made specially for Woolworths. If you read the label, it even says "packed specially for Woolworths". Note the wording. It clearly says "packed", and not "grown" or "made". In fact, KFC and Woolworths buy their chickens from exactly the same place, and so does Pick 'n Pay, and Spar, for that matter. So does half of South Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point I'm trying to make is that there are so many people that will go out and pay more to buy what they believe to be a superior product, but it is exactly the same as what they could have gotten anywhere else for cheaper. No that wasn't the point, I wasn't actually trying to make a point, but I made one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I don't understand is those vegetarians who give up meat because they don't believe in killing animals. Giving up meat for religious or medical reasons is something I respect. (I don't understand it, but I do respect it.) But if you don't believe in killing animals, why don't you protest against game reserves. Like the Kruger National Park. Did you know, that lions are actually allowed to go round killing animals indiscriminately. And they actually chase their food down and rip its throat out with their teeth. I've yet to meet a vegetarian who is against this practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you boycott meat, you should realise that plants have feelings too. If you think killing living creatures for food is horrible, I think ripping bits off and leaving the creature alive is even worse. Even those only eat fruit that has naturally fallen off the tree are quite disgusting. I really like steak, but if a cow was walking along, and a section of its backside fell off, I'd stay well away. It's just not right...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/7624728553845648881/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=7624728553845648881&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7624728553845648881'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/7624728553845648881'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-production-of-chicken.html' title='On the Production of Chicken'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/SbO7ZjlJxDI/AAAAAAAAAAk/qubhIoYSoKo/s72-c/n717903991_1096133_8238.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-829073829096527731</id><published>2009-03-04T17:52:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T13:08:58.002+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><title type='text'>On the Differences Between Robot Bunnies and Bunny Robots</title><content type='html'>They may seem like the same thing, but they most certainly are not.

Giant rabbits aren't exactly something you'd see every day (unless you are the owner of an abnormally large rabbit), but they certainly do exist. And if you saw a rabbit busy eating, you would not really be too surprised to find that it is in fact eating a salad. But, if you found that it was eating a chicken salad, you'd be mildly surprised.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; However, the logically conclusion you'd have to come to is that someone else had prepared the salad, and that the rabbit (being a rodent, and therefore prepared to eat anything) would eat it without giving it a thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: Rabbits have been known on occasion to eat through the type of steel fences that are commonly used to create their cages. Chickens don't, which is why fences of that sort of design are called "chicken wire" fences - not because they are used to enclose chickens, but because they keep chickens enclosed. They are often used to enclose rabbits, but, of course, rabbits eat chicken wire, so calling it rabbit wire would be a bit misleading. Contrary to popular belief, chicken wire is not made from chickens.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, If you were to see an abnormally large penguin eating a chicken salad, you would be very surprised. Especially if it was in your own kitchen. You have to rule out the fact that someone else would prepare a chicken salad for a penguin, as this would make no sense. A tuna salad would make sense, or a smoked salmon salad. A loving penguin owner may feel that a bucket full of raw fish is not enough, but preparing a chicken salad would be taking this a bit far. The only logical conclusion you can draw is that the penguin prepared its own salad, which is very likely to have involved a sharp knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the fact that the penguin could wield a knife isn't scary enough, you'd have to bear in mind that it was wielding a knife in you own home. And also bear in mind that this is a giant penguin, which is probably considerably stronger than your conventionally sized penguin. Penguins are not usually aggressive, but you don't know how this penguin was raised, or who it associates itself with. It could easily have been abandoned by its parents, bullied excessively by its peers, found and raised by the Mafia and trained to be a vicious killer. It may seem unlikely, but apart from what you've seen on TV, how much do you really know about the childhood of penguins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, it is probably not going to share. You're best option is to go get your own chicken salad. Or sandwich, or something... You could probably go steal from the rabbits if you really want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't get me wrong. I really like penguins, but you have to draw the line somewhere. If I was attacked by a knife-wielding penguin, I'd be willing to change my stance.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5230232660011377458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5230232660011377458&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5230232660011377458'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5230232660011377458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-giant-rabbits-eating-salad.html' title='On Giant Rabbits Eating Salad'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-720931647520891981</id><published>2009-02-23T15:01:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T15:48:10.762+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On the Nature of Problem Solving</title><content type='html'>I spent a large portion of my weekend trying to write a program to solve a particularly stubborn nonlinear equation.

Balancing is a naturally stable position for them. The problem is balancing cheeseburgers... plural.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The simple approach to this is to place the burgers next to each other on a flat horizontal surface. Since a single cheeseburger is a stable system, two independent cheese burgers will also be two independent stable systems. Given sufficient space, balancing any number of cheeseburgers is a trivial problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem only becomes non-trivial if one imposes constraints, either by limiting the space, or by limiting the type of surface to one that is either not flat, or not horizontal. Or both. For example, if the problem were to be restated as "Balance sixteen cheeseburgers on someone's head," this would transform a completely trivial problem into one that requires significant thought and skill to solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obvious solution is to devise some support for the cheeseburgers. However, in doing so, one must bear in mind the stability of the base. For example, one could drive a rigid steel support through all the cheese burgers and a sufficient depth into the base to ensure stability. However, driving a steel support to far into the base (which is someone's head) would increase the probability of the base falling over. One could take the idea one step further, and drive the steel support further down, into whatever the person is standing on, however this would require a great increase in the length of the support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all long supports, buckling now becomes an issue. One could increase the diameter of the support, but the diameter should not be so large that it affects the ability of the cheeseburgers to stay together. The support would thus need to have a steadily varying diameter, to ensure that it does not buckle in the lower portion of its length, and that it does not cause excessive damage to the cheeseburgers along the upper portion of its length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sort of grip will need to be designed so that the base does not slip off, and a mechanism would need to be attached to the top of the support to apply a constant pressure to the cheese burgers. This is necessary to ensure that contact is maintained between the cheeseburgers and the base (which is not explicitly stated, but is certainly implied by the problem statement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings one to the question of whether using a support really is balancing, however, this question is irrelevant. It is true that the problem did specifically state that the cheeseburgers must balance, but surely this is imposing an unnecessary constraint on the solutions. The problem needs to be restated so that this constraint is removed. The new problem, structured to suit the devised solution is "Get sixteen cheeseburgers to stay on someone's head." If there really was a reason that the cheeseburgers had to balance (taking the word literally), then the easiest solution would be to fit each cheeseburger with electric fans and an intelligent control system to maintain stability. But what is the difference between using the air for support and using a steel rod?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be asking at this point what the point to all this is. I think that's a stupid question. If you wanted to ask an intelligent question, you need to start with "Why?"&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5480370034164144739/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5480370034164144739&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5480370034164144739'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5480370034164144739'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/02/on-balancing-cheeseburgers.html' title='On Balancing Cheeseburgers'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3520633936197990903</id><published>2009-02-22T12:05:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.462+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poetry'/><title type='text'>On Poetic Licences</title><content type='html'>Where do you get them? Are they expensive? Who decided that you had to have them? I think its a major scam to make money from stupid people. What other reason could there be for people charging money to issue a licence, just so people don't have to learn how to structure a sentence properly.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, take the lines "The silver-blue sky, beheld by the eye," which have obviously been chosen because they rhyme. Why doesn't the poet just say. "The sky is blue." And why does he have to point out that it can be seen. That is obvious. When ever the colour of an object is pointed out, it is generally assumed that anyone (with the notable exception of blind people) can see what colour it is, unless it is specifically stated, as in "The sky is blue, but we're six hundred metres underground, so you can't tell."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, poets have been doing this sort of thing, and I've never worked out why. I've always believed poets are people with insufficient grasp of language to structure a sentence properly, but not enough musical understanding to work the words into a song. Yet when one studies English at school, poetry makes up a fair portion of the curriculum.

From fancy computer systems to cellphones, smart irrigation systems and intelligent fridges and toilets. I am slowly beginning to realize that the majority of people have no clue how these technologies work, never mind how to use them. Arthur C. Clarke said that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; This is rubbish, obviously, because someone had to develop that technology, and that someone would have needed to understand the workings behind it (presumably). The people who can't tell it is not magic are the ignorant users, who are probably not engineers. I've always wondered how things work, and I've always made an effort to understand every technology I've used, even if it is on a very elementary level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology has replaced so many brains. Apart from the obvious culprit of the internet (which is, of course, always right - even when it contradicts itself), there is another major culprit that is even more widely believed. Most people know it as GPS, a few confuse it with GPRS, and most don't actually know what it stands for. A lot think it stands for Global Positioning Satellite, but these are people who don't think. If that were correct, then those who say they have had GPS installed in their cars are idiots. By definition, a satellite is something in free orbit around the earth. To install a satellite in ones car either means that one has brought down a satellite, or is planning on sending their car (together with this satellite) into space. Actually, GPS refers to any Global Positioning System, but we now use it to refer to those systems that use satellites. The interesting thing about GPS maps is that they only know what they've been told. They don't have a brain to work things out for themselves, ad they don't learn from their mistakes (neither do most people). They know nothing about road closures, and they only know about 90% of roads. I found out recently that even major roads aren't properly recorded on GPS maps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman was looking for a place, which she knew was in Sandton, so she drove to Sandton. Since Sandton, is about 10 km across, and the busiest commercial hub in the country, she landed up driving through rush hour traffic for 40 minutes to get to the centre. She then phoned the place to find out where it actually was. It turns out that it is on the very edge of Sandton. She enters the address into her GPS and is told that it doesn't exist. So she phones the place again and tells them they don't exist, because they aren't on the GPS. This results in a big argument, with one side remaining calm, and the other completely losing their temper. The place she was looking for (a hospital that had occupied that address - which happens to be on a main road - for forty something years) had obviously been using the wrong address since it was built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People need to remember to use their brains when dealing with technology. The only problem is that remembering that requires the use of a brain, an art which is only carried on by a steadily declining minority.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2891087677620707477/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2891087677620707477&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2891087677620707477'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2891087677620707477'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/02/on-learning-to-use-technology.html' title='On Learning to Use Technology'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-3686875971769730221</id><published>2009-02-14T18:29:00.008+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.466+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tuna'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stereotypes'/><title type='text'>On Stupid Children: Part II</title><content type='html'>Today I saw a child walking along with a balloon on a stick. They were pushing it along the ground, swinging it from side to side, as one would use a metal detector. The ballon popped, and the child just stood and stared. I'm not sure she understood what had happened.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; That's OK. The child was very young, maybe three or four years old. It was easy to forgive her. A regular dose of tuna, and she will be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that worried me was the mother. She stared at the balloon with exactly the same expression as the child. To me this really implies that she didn't understand what had happened either. It is her parents that failed by not giving her enough tuna as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I had first hand experience on the power of tuna. I have been taking tuna oil supplements for a while now, but I decided that stopping for a week wouldn't make any difference. I was wrong. Within one week, I became an outgoing person. It was horrible. I've been back on my tuna for 6 days now, and I've turned back into a quiet nerd. Thank God. I'd hate to have to be talkative for the rest of my life.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3686875971769730221/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3686875971769730221&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3686875971769730221'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3686875971769730221'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/02/on-stupid-children-part-ii.html' title='On Stupid Children: Part II'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1218061681345054821</id><published>2009-02-14T13:11:00.011+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:06:26.916+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='houses'/><title type='text'>On the Destructive Potential of Ants</title><content type='html'>(Editor's note: To those of you who found this by Googling "can ants be destructive", or "do ants eat brick", or something similar, I advise you read the post on &lt;a href="http://alphanumericsheeppig.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-google-searches.html"&gt;Google Searches&lt;/a&gt;, which does contain the actual answer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house became infested with ants a couple of weeks ago.

And ants don't eat wood. As far as I can tell, they eat leaves, other insects, and chocolate, and cake, and almost anything else. But not wood. That eased my fears a little, until one day in the kitchen cupboard, I noticed a line of ants crawling out of a hole in the wall. Ants don't eat wood, or bricks, but they do dig. Brick and cement are no obstacle to them. That got me wondering. Could ants dig through a house until the point that it collapses. And how do I know how many holes are running through my wall.

The terrain is scattered with small hills. At some points, these hills run parallel to the road. Along the highest ridge visible from the road, there are lines of trees, various heights and types, but all equally spaced.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; The arrangement and precise location of these trees is too coincidental to be a natural occurrence, and since the surrounding country side contains nothing but farms, one has to assume that the farmers must have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's my engineering mind that realised the problem. It's just the technical difficulties of lining the trees so precisely, often a few kilometres from the road.. One person would have had to be on the road, sitting in a car (so that his head is at the right height). He would have the direct the farmer (probably over radio), so that the farmer could mark the highest line on the hill visible from the road. He would then have to use a tape measure and mark off the intervals, and then plant the trees. It all sounds like a lot of pointless effort to me...&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/2501456443004967000/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=2501456443004967000&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2501456443004967000'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/2501456443004967000'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/02/on-farmers-and-equally-spaced-trees.html' title='On Farmers and Equally-Spaced Trees'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-4046973385551153537</id><published>2009-02-14T12:25:00.006+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.467+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On "Take A Seat"</title><content type='html'>It was in a small town where English is a language that is rarely spoken.

You're lucky I make back ups... Original from 24 January 2009, Posted by Alphanumeric Sheep Pig at 12:15 PM. Reposted on 5 April 2009 at 6:53 PM.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on holiday for the last week, so I have had nothing to do, and have been extremely bored. The main result of boredom is to do nothing and be bored, which means I spent most of my days in bed sleeping, on the couch sleeping, and so on. Every morning, I have been reluctant to get up, and I am only eating breakfast at the time when I would normally be starting lunch.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; This has left me feeling tired and lazy. As a result, I have been too lazy to shave. The result is that my chin was starting to itch. An itch almost always leads to a scratch, and without noticing, my hand came up to scratch my chin. My mind was completely switched off and no thought was passing through my mind. Suddenly, some faraway noise brought me back to reality, and I noticed my elbow on the table and my fingers at my chin. I realised that I must have had a glazed expression, and if anyone had been there to see, I would have looked very deep in thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things like that always make me laugh. The only time I ever look deep in thought is if I'm not in the mood for thinking. I think best when I'm doing something completely unrelated to what I'm trying to think about. The only time I ever look like I'm thinking is if I'm really tired and trying to disguise it, or if I can't concentrate, and want to hide that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole event made me realise that I need to find something to do. Suffering from attacks of boredom in the past, I have done a number of really pointless things. I could list them here, but that would be pointless. However, I am bored, and in the mood to do pointless things. I'm not only going to list them... I'm going to explain them. One of the first things I did was to program a DOS version for minesweeper. The best part of this was that it was that, although it could be made to run on Windows 98 with some dificulty, it was completely incompatible with Windows XP. Why did I do it like that? Because I am happiest when there is no point to what I am doing. I then went on to analyse the logic needed in solving minesweeper, and attempted to program a minesweeper solver. The problem is that you do occasionally need to guess - which means it is impossible to write a perfectly reliable solver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I have tried is to play God. I wrote a massive program (which I have since lost...) that generates a two dimensional universe which loops round on itself (in a non spherical way - an attempt to make the universe endless). In this universe, a number of little creatures have various combinations and levels of three skills and three related urges. The skills are hunting, strength and fertility, and the urges are eating, fighting and mating. How much any particular creature is affected by these is defined by its DNA, which is inherited as a combination of it's parents DNA. The creatures would die if they didn't eat regularly enough, or if they sustained to many injuries in a particular fight, or if they got too old. There was a limit on the population, because the computer would crash if all the memory was used. The whole aim was to see if I could get behaviour out of the creatures that was not deliberately programmed in, and if they would reach a steady state population that was not the maximum. The interesting thing was that they did. The creatures turned out to be social, (because two thirds of the population were either stalking a victim or a potential mate, and anyone who strayed alone would not have children and would die). They formed one big city, however, occasionally a crazed psycopath would scare enough people into one place that a new town would form, which would become completely isolated from the rest. The population did reach a steady state value, but that was highly dependant on the starting conditions. The initial population needed to be aggressive enough to keep itself in check. It explains why humans are so aggressive. We needed to be to prevent us from expanding to rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also tried to make a massive campaign for Starcraft... That didn't turn out to well. Recently I tried to design the fastest and highest manned jet ever - to beat the SR-71. Its not possible to do it with the conceptual design I had in mind, and after spending almost a week on it, I didn't have the patience to start again from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I thought of now is something I decided a while ago. I'd design a full suit like in Ironman. That means I'd have to do an accurate 3D dynamic model of a human body. I don't think I have the patience to do that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should just stick to sleeping... I'm too lazy for now. I shaved this morning, so hopefully the problem has been postponed for a few more days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/3852807869648837211/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=3852807869648837211&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3852807869648837211'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/3852807869648837211'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-results-of-boredom-and-not-very.html' title='On the Results of Boredom and Not-Very-Thoughtful Chin-Scratching'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8782733801479056535</id><published>2009-01-18T12:58:00.007+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-07T13:15:03.443+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='engineering'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='domesticated animals'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='food'/><title type='text'>On Flying Monkeys and Cheese Flavoured Goats</title><content type='html'>Well, not really. But it could have been. Its actually not really about anything, really. There's no such thing as cheese flavoured goats. Unless you cut a piece of cheese into a goat shape. Or a goat shaped cheese flavoured cracker. Either way, it's not a cheese flavoured goat, because it's not technically a goat - it's just a goat-shaped object. If you wanted a cheese flavoured goat, you'd have to kidnap a baby goat and inject it with cheese flavoured chemicals (like the ones on Nik Naks) for it's entire life.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; (Are those chemicals poisonous to goats? Maybe you need to run some tests first.) Even then, I can't guarantee that the goats would be cheese flavoured. I have no idea how often the chemical would need to be administered, or what dosage to use. Several tests and experiments would need to be performed first. You may need to enlist the help of an expert. I have no experience in this field. Why would you want a cheese flavoured goat anyway? (On a side note: Goat's milk does make nice cheese.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't about flying monkeys either. I don't know what made you think it was. Monkeys don't fly, unless they've been genetically mutated. I suppose you could train chimpanzees to fly aeroplanes (chimpanzees are more intelligent than humans), but I'd like to point out that chimpanzees are technically not monkeys (due to the absence of a tail). You could also just put a monkey on an aeroplane (which has happened many times in the past), but is this really a flying monkey, or is it just a monkey being flown? You have to understand that there is a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy six thousand monkeys, and train them to throw pumpkins with their feet. Where could I get them? Where do circuses and mad scientists buy their monkeys from? Could I get them for free? I wouldn't be able to afford them. I'm always looking for a free way to find what I want. I hate having to pay for anything. Even if I got hold of these monkeys, would they be able to hold pumpkins in their feet. Monkey feet are quite small, and pumpkins are big and heavy. This makes them pretty effective weapons. I thought of using carrots instead, but carrots don't really have much weight behind them. Pumpkins are a far more powerful. In order to make full use of them, I'm going to have to breed special monkeys, with bigger feet and stronger legs. And maybe breed smaller pumpkins, but I really think this takes away from the whole point in using pumpkins in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone want six thousand monkeys? My plan is to dress them in silk pajamas and woolen hats, and send them to Indonesia to start a religious war. What do I have against Indonesia? Nothing, actually.

However, I have never really understood why. All I knew was that it was caused by a recurring Cholesteatoma, what ever that is.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; Last time I went to the doctor, he asked if I'd ever looked it up. He was surprised when I told him I hadn't. Today, I looked it up on Wikipedia, which tells me that "Cholesteatoma is a destructive and expanding keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear and/or mastoid process."&lt;br /&gt;Yeah sure... that really explains it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did learn is that I suffer from tinnitus, which is a common condition caused by various inner and middle ear problems. Basically it means I have sound hallucinations. I hear people talking when there's no-one there, and songs when they aren't playing. And a constant beeping. This plays hell in hearing tests. "When you hear the beep, press the button." the tester tells me. I nod. I hear a beep, and so I press the button. "Only press it when you hear a beep." comes the testers voice again. The problem is that when there is a beep, which anyone should be able to hear, I can't hear it. Is a hearing test a valid medical test if it doesn't work for people like me? Last time I went through it, the audiologist told me that I had the minimum possible score. if I had any lower, they would have thrown the test results away. Bearing in mind that I might have been imagining beeps when the machine really was beeping below the limits of my hearing, one has to admit that the test results should have been thrown away anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, the beeping used to give me panic attacks when I was a child. In the test, the beep stops the moment you press the button. Lying in bed at night, the beeping would start, and I'd begin frantically pressing an imaginary button to get the noise to stop.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On another side note, a study suggested that 93% of tinnitus free people will experience a perception of beeping, whistling, buzzing or pulsing when placed in an anechoic chamber - which is exactly where they place you to perform a hearing test. Did they know that when they developed the test?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, the unit used to measure sound levels is the decibel, which is the logarithm of the ratio of power transmitted in a sound to the power carried by a sound that is at the limit of human hearing, divided by 10. In other words, it uses the limit of human hearing as a datum. Since everone's limit is different, how does this work. It is an arbitrary datum, so how can it be scientifically acceptable. Scientists are weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an engineering point of veiw, my hearing loss is very useful. It is about 85 dB in my right ear, which is exactly the maximum noise level allowable by the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Above this, one is required to use earplugs, or permanent ear damage may result. By simply blocking my left ear, I have a perfectly reliable test to see whether or not earplugs are required by the Act. A useless super power, but it's better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry, I like side notes. Here's another one. I went through most of school and university telling people that my deafness was due to a tumour. Apparently I was wrong: "The status of cholesteatomas as tumors is currently unresolved. There is some evidence to support the hypothesis that cholesteatomas are low-grade tumors however, recent studies have failed to show consistent DNA instability in cholesteatomas (as a tumour would)."

When I was a child, psychiatrists used to give you a box with different shapes cut in the lid. Along with that they would give you the wooden blocks that would fit into the holes. Each block only fits through one of the holes. The test was simple... if you could get each of the blocks in the box with just one try, you had developed intelligence.&lt;span id="readmore"&gt; If any child needs more than one attempt, they are either blind, or stupid. In a one year old, stupidity is expected. In a three year old, it is slightly worrying. In a five year old, the psychiatrist will give the parents a list of "special" schools for "special" children. It is not good news for the parents when this happens. The child doesn't mind... He doesn't understand what it means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there is a box in the shop, which contains eight smaller boxes. A child, aged possibly between eight and ten (it may have been a slightly tall 7 year old) picked up one of the boxes, leaving a rectangular shaped gap. When he was finished looking at it, he put it back, but in the process he had turned it through an angle of ninety degrees. A child of reasonable intelligence would see the shape of the hole, see the shape of the box, and make the connection in their brains. This child, however, tried to force the box in sidewards. Upon seeing that it wouldn't fit, a slightly stupid child would then wonder why, and eventually work out that the box needs to be rotated through an angle of positive or negative ninety degrees. Unfortunately, this child was worse than just slightly stupid. He bent the cardboard so that the box would fit. He needs to eat more tuna. It helps the brain make those sorts of connections. I would have recommended this to his parents if they had been there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar situation happens with another box next to it. This box contains twenty smaller boxes which are slightly off square. It is amazing how many people, even adults put them back in sideways. Special schools are definitely under utilised nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads on to the situation with the stairs. Upstairs contains just empty boxes. There is nothing to see there, so it is closed off from the customers by lining the stairs with stock and placing a large advertising poster at the top of the stairs, thereby completely blocking it off. Two girls, aged maybe three and five? enter the store. The younger one begins to climb the stairs, but the older one immediately shouts "No! You can't go up. It's closed off." At some different point in time, a boy (aged maybe seventeen) walks in (Admittedly, he was slouched over, dressed completely in black, with his hair dyed black and hanging over his eyes. Wanting to look different, but ending up looking like every other emo on the planet...) and goes straight up the stairs and pushes aside the poster - just to see the empty boxes. Yes, the stupid eight year old might need just a school, but the parents of the seventeen year old need to start thinking of special homes. Keep him out of public and save him from all the embarasment his stupidity might cause him. If a five year old can work it out, then why can't he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A related problem I find is the inability to grasp basic concepts. At closing time, just before I cash up, I close and lock the door (for security reasons), which I used to believe would imply that the store was closed. It is amazing how many people knock on the door and ask "Are you closed?" However, these people must be given some credit, since the possibility that the store might just be closed has actually crossed their minds. Even more amazing is the number of people who don't ask, and just walk into the door. Upon finding that it is not open, they take the handle and shake it. Few of them look inside to see me shaking my head. Such behaviour is extremely worrying. Did their parents force them to live such sheltered lives that this is their first encounter with a locked door? Or are they so stupid that they did not make any connection with previos encounters with locked doors. One wonders how they manage with other everyday tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuna, people... Tuna. Try it... It really works.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/4130422357610243789/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=4130422357610243789&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4130422357610243789'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/4130422357610243789'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/01/on-door-walkers-and-stupid-children.html' title='On Door-Walkers and Stupid Children'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6945593283764644710</id><published>2009-01-17T15:18:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-16T09:36:35.470+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='incompetence'/><title type='text'>On Idiots and Morons</title><content type='html'>[A post that got mysteriously lost (i.e. accidentally deleted), and then recovered.

The snow had stopped, the mist was being pushed out, and the landscape beneath her metal cave on this concrete and steel mountain was slowly being revealed. Stretching all four of her massive metallic membrane wings as best she could in the limited space, she began to claw her way toward the opening. She let out a rusty cry as a ray of moonlight pierced through the mist and hit lit up her three heads. The screech echoed of the landscape, but no cry responded. She launched herself off the platform, and spread her wings wide. The fall seemed to take forever, but eventually there was enough air to fill her wings, and she began to glide. With one powerful downward sweep, she transformed the nose dive into forward flight. Drawing her wings back against her body, she began to clap them together, sending a powerful burst of air downwards and backwards, thrusting her body forward through the air. Steadily, she increased the rhythm of the clap, and pushed her three heads together. The force of the air flowing past her accelerating mass pushed her claws against her body, and pulled her tail out straight behind her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She pulled up into a steady climb, rising above the clouds into the cool dark air of the midwinter night, still accelerating. She tensed up as she sensed shockwaves beginning to form on the tips of her wings. Her ears automatically sealed to protect them from the deafening bang of the shockwave that formed on the tip of her foremost beak as she broke through the sound barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air in front of her became like a steel wall, but she forced her wings together, now in a motion far more complicated than a simple clap, and her speed continued to increase steadily. The icy shards that had begun to form along her smooth body began to melt in the incredible heat generated by the air friction. A secondary heart began to pump, gently at first but getting stronger rapidly. It propelled not blood, but a liquid metal alloy, which did not transport oxygen, or any material substance, but rather energy. More specifically, heat. She separated her three heads. The thrusting of her wings was no longer enough to keep her body accelerating, but she had climbed high enough. She stopped her wings, and held them slightly apart; spread only just enough to stop her from spinning out of control. Her trajectory followed the classic parabola followed by all free projectiles, and this brought her into a dive. Trading altitude for speed, she began to drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips of her three beaks began to glow red with the heat, and the metallic blood which flowed just below the surface began to boil. The second heart pumped harder, and the gas was forced through the swollen veins to the membrane of the front pair of wings. There, the heat gradient between the two pairs of wings caused an electric current. Blue yellow sparks arced from one wing to the other. She crashed her wings together, releasing a massive bolt of lightning, which ripped through the air around her. She slowly brought her wings apart again, and the arcing returned. Again, her wings crashed together, this time sending a bolt of electricity towards her tail. She continued this, each bolt of lightning providing thrust. In between thrusts, the incredible drag, now several times here own weight, was sapping away at a large portion of the extra speed. A slight twitch of her tail brought her path parallel to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She began clapping her wings faster and faster, the rapid acceleration and deceleration sending a terrible vibration through her body. Any movement other than the flapping of her wings was now impossible. The slightest turn of one of her heads would snap her neck and send her spinning out of control toward the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shock of each thrust burned through her skeleton. The thick atmosphere, which had provided the energy to reach this speed, was quickly becoming a curse, preventing her from accelerating further. Another imperceptible flick of her tail sent ripples through her entire body which resonated with the thrust of her wings. Further flicks maintained and magnified these waves which bounced between her heads and tail. The vibration forced the air at her sides to move out of the way, and a complex pattern of shockwaves surrounded her. Far to slow to keep up with her body, the air left vacuum pockets, which quickly spread over her entire body. The only air touching her now was a single molecule at the tip of each beak, which provided almost no opposition. Now free from the drag which had limited her before, there was no longer anything to hold her back. However, the source of her energy had also been eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was still some heat to be distributed, and the charge in her wings would last another couple of seconds at least. Thunder crashed as her wings crashed together, far faster than ever before, now that there was no air between them to hold them back. The lightning released was far more powerful, stripping the surrounding air into its atomic constituents. Further flaps did the same, and ignited the air. Engulfed in flames, Sarieth continued to accelerate forwards. Light and infrared radiation from the flames now did what the air friction had done before – provided the heat to power her thrust. The whole procedure had set her on a climbing trajectory. The tail no longer provided the necessary disturbance to maintain the vibration, but in the time it took the vibration to damp out, such a distance would have been covered, that it did not matter. The air grew thinner as her altitude increased, until it eventually disappeared. Now gravity was the only force holding her back, but it was in a much diminished form. Even more so now, as her momentum carried her high up, where the sun was merely a big ball of glowing fire, providing only direct light. There was no scattered ambient light as within the atmosphere, and likewise, there was no ambient heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gills located at the base of her neck opened and flexed. Exhaling briefly but rapidly through the right gill caused her to turn gradually left. An identical burst through left gill halted the turn. This completely altered her trajectory one orbiting the sun. Her wings, although no longer flapping, now lay outstretched. The larger front pair cast a shadow which completely obscured the rear wings from the light. Although the front wings had carried the bulk of the heat (and still did), the propulsive exercise had warmed the rear wings considerably. They now glowed slightly in the dark as they radiated excess energy. Their surface temperature began to plummet. The front wings, however, were in direct sunlight, and were barely cooling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As before, the temperature difference induced a voltage between the two pairs of wings, but this time, Sarieth did not clap her wings together, but held them steady, maintaining an electric field between them. It is popular belief that space is empty, but this is in fact far from the truth. Far out it interstellar space, there may be millions of miles between atoms, but here, in the relative proximity of planets, asteroids and comets, dust particles and rogue molecules were scattered so frequently that there was rarely more than a metre between particles. A large number of the dust particles carry some small static charge, and the majority of stray molecules were ionised, having been catapulted from their source with extremely high energy, either in some form of collision, or a nuclear explosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in Sarieth’s electric field, the particles began to gather on the front and back wings (depending on the nature of their charge), forming a barely visible film. Slowly, they began to be absorbed into her bloodstream, which transported them to an unusual organ located at the tip of her tail, where they were collected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a speed far in excess of the planets, Sarieth could orbit the star in a hundredth of the time of even the fastest planet; however this still took several hours. After several such orbits, the swelling that had formed at the tip of her tail was impossible to detect without extremely sophisticated instruments. Releasing an incredible amount of energy that had been built up for decades, Sarieth detonated a burst of energy at the edge of the sphere that had formed. The blast was directed rearward, forming a nuclear fusion chain reaction amongst the absorbed molecules, forming a single massive atom containing several millions of billions of subatomic particles, which by the theoretical laws of classical atomic physics, should never have been allowed to exist; should have ripped itself apart almost instantaneously. However, due to an anomaly in the quantum nature of time, the time period in which this needed to occur did not exist. In order to conserve the mass-energy balance, a ripple of uncertainty ran through the fabric of the space-time continuum around her body. Local space began to distort around her, expanding to allow the atomic decomposition. When space was finally distorted enough to allow the atomic decomposition to occur, it did, and a fission reaction occurred, only to produce products which were almost as unstable as the original atom. A second fission reaction occurred, and then a third, continuing on in an endless explosion, which ripped apart the last third of Sarieth’s tail. The thrust produced in the distorted reality was inconceivably tremendous, accelerating her to a fair fraction of the speed of light. The only thing that limited her was the fact that her mass was steadily increasing and time around her was slowing. At almost a tenth of the speed of light, the reaction had run out. As it did so, space collapsed back to normality, and her speed, which had been a tenth of the speed of light in distorted space, now exceeded it by several billion times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality had essentially been tricked, which sounds really unusual, but don't worry - It happens all the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this incredible speed, her mass was beyond infinite, collapsing the entire universe instantaneously into a singularity, however, outside her own body, nothing happened. Time no longer flowed in a linear fashion, but rather oscillated and looped back within itself that one could no longer describe in a simple one dimensional coordinate. Even a ten dimensional coordinate would barely be adequate. Space, on the other hand, had been compressed into one dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside this anomaly, in normal three dimensional space, with one dimensional time, Sarieth ceased to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many billions of years earlier, at the far edge of the universe, a small tear appeared in the gravitational fabric that formed the border between existence, and nothingness. Existence began to fade, flowing out into the endless nothingness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it could, the nothingness would have had a gently satisfied smile. Sarieth reformed into reality right at the beginning of time, the universe erased from existence. She glided gracefully through the emptiness. No more stupid laws of physics to hold her back from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/feeds/5936406150801173491/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7253891661294505258&amp;postID=5936406150801173491&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5936406150801173491'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/5936406150801173491'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/01/on-as-yet-unrealised-evolution-of.html' title='On the As Yet Unrealised Evolution of Natural Ultra High Speed Flight.'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.page-4080966703546616876</id><published>2015-06-04T10:22:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2015-06-04T10:22:04.160+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#page'/><title type='text'>On Very Little, Actually</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="clear: both; float: left; padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"&gt; &lt;img border="0" height="200" width="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dgO5bCQVQYM/Tf8HQg9kv4I/AAAAAAAAAWs/yC3vd070pjs/s400/alphanumericsheep.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because there's not much to say. I am still young and inexperienced. I fell in to the academic trap and was stuck at university for far too many years, but I eventually finished my PhD in 2015. I think of food a lot, and have surprisingly little to do with farm animals. My hobbies are eating and sleeping. Apart from that, I enjoy anything that looks challenging but is actually simple and repetitive. Like maths, or computer programming, or solving Rubik's cube over and over. I like trying to understand things (usually with success) and people (usually unsuccessfully). I also blog (Duh!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, I am prone to expressing a level of self-confidence that is often mistaken for arrogance, and I have a titanium implant in my skull that looks just like an audio jack, and works more or less like one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do want more than that, you'll have to read some of my posts, but for those of you who are lazy, here's a bit of a longer summary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a fairly early age, my parents raised me to have &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/01/on-why.html" target="_blank"&gt;an  inquisitive mind&lt;/a&gt;, which led me to find &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/04/on-results-of-boredom-and-not-very.html" target="_blank"&gt;unusual cures for boredom&lt;/a&gt;, often involving &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/my-mind-is-quite-prone-to-urges-to-look.html" target="_blank"&gt; pointless amounts of mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. My interests were heavily influenced by my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/on-grandparents.html" target="_blank"&gt;grandparents&lt;/a&gt;, one of whom bought several electric kits for my father, which were later passed down to me, so I became quite aquainted with &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/on-electrocution.html" target="_blank"&gt;electrocution&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of this, I am still terrified of unexpected &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-door-handle-sparks.html" target="_blank"&gt;shocks from door handles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been plagued by chronic ear infections my whole life, and at the age of nine, I was diagnosed with my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/01/on-modern-medicine-and-measurement-of.html" target="_blank"&gt;first not-a-tumour&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, I'm &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-some-vaguely-related-ideas.html" target="_blank"&gt;mostly deaf on one side&lt;/a&gt;. I was on cortisone medication for half my childhood, which my mom blames for my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/06/on-abnormality-of-standard-sizes.html" target="_blank"&gt;slightly abnormal size&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not all that's wrong with me. Like so many kids, I was &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/08/on-adhd-and-sprained-ankle.html" target="_blank"&gt;formally diagnosed with ADD&lt;/a&gt;, which was probably due to my tendency to do things like &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/03/on-pointlessness-of-bookmarks_01.html" target="_blank"&gt;chew on bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/03/on-pens-pencils-and-paper.html" target="_blank"&gt;spin pens around&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/03/on-annoying-noises.html" target="_blank"&gt; tap, hit and knock on things&lt;/a&gt; (although the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/10/on-door-knocking.html" target="_blank"&gt;knocking only started later on in life&lt;/a&gt; because I could never work out how to knock on doors when I was younger), and the fact that I just have to have &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-fictional-nature-of-isolated.html" target="_blank"&gt; something to keep my hands busy if my mind is occupied&lt;/a&gt;. This, together with some compulsive behaviours like my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/09/on-eating-in-order.html" target="_blank"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/11/on-layered-meals.html" target="_blank"&gt;layered meals&lt;/a&gt;, and my lack of &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/06/on-depth-perception-problems-and-meal.html" target="_blank"&gt;depth perception&lt;/a&gt; has led me to now believe I may not have ADD, but rather some form of high-functioning autism. I have been seriously considering getting an official diagnosis, but I lack the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/09/on-swearing.html" target="_blank"&gt;swear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/10/on-psychoactive-drugs.html" target="_blank"&gt;don't do drugs&lt;/a&gt;, enjoy &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/09/on-productive-use-of-compulsory-leisure.html" target="_blank"&gt;sitting in traffic&lt;/a&gt;, and my idea of formal wear is &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/04/on-collared-shirts.html" target="_blank"&gt; newer jeans and a slightly neater T-shirt&lt;/a&gt;. Despite what my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/05/on-suspicious-interests.html" target="_blank"&gt;library reading list says&lt;/a&gt;, I'm not planning world domination. Surprisingly, my &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/06/on-dreams-part-ii.html" target="_blank"&gt;dreams are incredibly mundane&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to what people seem to think, I'm &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/06/on-games-of-logic.html" target="_blank"&gt;useless at chess&lt;/a&gt;, and I &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/03/on-sports.html" target="_blank"&gt;don't enjoy watching sports unless I can apply plenty of maths to it as the game progresses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying statistics and mathematics to problems is my one true cure for boredom. If I can't sleep at night, I start worrying about &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2009/05/on-winter-problems.html" target="_blank"&gt;statistics problems&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/06/on-efficiency-of-natural-night-time.html" target="_blank"&gt; thermodynamic efficiency of my duvet&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I do this all the time - from worrying about how efficiently I'm &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/01/on-quartering-of-sandwiches.html" target="_blank"&gt;slicing my sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/enchantment-level-vs-bookshelf-part-iii.html" target="_blank"&gt;digging in the source code of video games so that I can calculate an optimal way to play&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoy challenges, and whenever I overcome one, it leads to a &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/04/on-disabling-effect-of-sense-of.html" target="_blank"&gt;sense of fulfilment which makes me useless for the rest of the day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk around with an &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/on-seeing-world-in-polarised-light.html" target="_blank"&gt;expression of wonder on my face&lt;/a&gt; (which gets some weird stares), but who can blame me. &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/07/on-everything-it-is-just-so-damn.html" target="_blank"&gt;Everything is just so damn amazing&lt;/a&gt;. It frustrates me that other's &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2012/09/open-source-and-the-way-people-see-the-world.html" target="_blank"&gt;see the world differently from me&lt;/a&gt;. I really wish people would just really &lt;a href="http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/04/on-fruits-and-vegetables.html" target="_blank"&gt;think about it&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/pages/default/4080966703546616876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/pages/default/4080966703546616876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.alphasheep.co.za/p/on-very-little-actually.html' title='On Very Little, Actually'/><author><name>Alphanumeric Sheep Pig</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='29' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_o0B0PpN-u7A/Sn8Qj-T7UII/AAAAAAAAAB4/zX6X3P1H-6k/S220-s32/alphanumericsheep.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dgO5bCQVQYM/Tf8HQg9kv4I/AAAAAAAAAWs/yC3vd070pjs/s72-c/alphanumericsheep.jpg' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.page-6864261482214181497</id><published>2013-01-21T16:03:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T16:03:49.264+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#page'/><title type='text'>On that really annoying advertising.</title><content type='html'>I really dislike adverts when my favourite TV shows are interrupted by adverts. Same with the radio. But, that is how the money is raised to pay all of the expenses. Without the adverts, either there would be no TV or radio, or we would have to pay a ridiculous subscription to cover the costs of maintaining a station, employing staff, and broadcasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running a website is the same. It may be far cheaper to run than a television channel, but there are still costs involved. My domain registration for one. Sure, there are free alternatives, but having a legitimately registered domain boosts the credibility of my website and new visitors are far more likely to follow a link to my blog. Registering a legitimate domain quadrupled my blog traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog also takes some time to put together and maintain. It may not look like much, but each post takes a couple of hours to type out, not to mention the time spent on appearance and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I made the decision to put adverts on my site. I know most people don't like annoying adverts, but that's too bad. It's not that difficult. You could always use an ad blocker, but people who use things like that are just selfish and are denying hundreds of websites an honest income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.

Some of those that are definitely worth visiting are &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Webcomics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://survivingtheworld.net/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surviving the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Daily Lessons in Science, Literature, Love and Life. The best photocomic I've ever read.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;xkcd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A must read for anyone who enjoys maths or has any sense of humour.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The System&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A comic made using the standard international signage elements.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ctrl + Alt + Del&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A comic about a pair of gamers. And Scott and his pet penguin, who don't show up nearly enough&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - The original "two gamers on a couch" webcomic.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://leasticoulddo.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Least I Could Do&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Amusing story about an arrogant know-it-all that you can't help liking.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Random comics, usually about nothing useful. however, they are very well researched, and always entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Piled Higher &amp;amp; Deeper&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - The best insight into the life that anyone doing a higher degree through research inevitably gets stuck in.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blogs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://revengeofthenerdette.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revenge of the Nerdette&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A blog by a good friend of mine.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mpi.andrewmrees.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Plans for Infiniti&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - One of the best written blogs around, and really worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://atomictoasters.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atomic Toasters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A tech blog that doesn't cover the latest iPhone app or new 3D TVs, but rather focuses on obscure, random or forgotten technology and gadgets.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Online Stores&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Think Geek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Where I do my shirt shopping. They also have pretty much every cool gadget you could possibly want.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sheldonshirts.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sheldon Shirts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - The sources of most of the T-shirts seen on the TV Series &lt;i&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt;. They also tell you where you can get other awesome stuff from the show, like the FlipFold Clothing Folding Board.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Forums&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.awx.co.za/forum/list.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;AWX&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - It's actually an anime and gaming store, but it's the forum that I frequent most often.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceforums.net/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ScienceForums.net&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Where I go when I need to feel stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Software&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome.html?hl=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Nice and uncluttered layout, integration with your Google account, fast, and a million times better than any Internet Explorer. If you already use Firefox, then it's mostly the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Best free image editing software out there. It can do everything any commercial package can, and needs almost no space to install.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Notepad++&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Like notepad on steroids, it's just a text editor, but has every feature you want as a coder, including filters for just about every known programming language known to man...&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;More Alphanumeric Sheep Pig&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/alphasheep.co.za"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Like me!&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/09041863769243191210"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blogger Profile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  - Just for interest's sake.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sheeppig"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twitter Profile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - For those who use the world's most popular spam engine.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/473553693"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Myspace Profile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - although who actually still uses MySpace?&lt;/li&gt;

Another reason why this is a problem is because the hot water takes ages to actually warm up, so using the cold water is necessary in order to not waste time (plus it is absolutely disgusting to not wash your hands...) A solution would be to warm your hands with the air dryer, but we all know why that is a no-go... Who knew it could be so stressful?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/6922004217608951659/comments/default/5705578630346958915'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/6922004217608951659/comments/default/5705578630346958915'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-valve-to-spout-ratio.html?showComment=1279905236950#c5705578630346958915' title=''/><author><name>Robot</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/05838102626356475373</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-valve-to-spout-ratio.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6922004217608951659' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6922004217608951659' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1655518386'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='23 July, 2010 19:13'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-8323147840760098320</id><published>2010-08-03T19:17:45.475+02:00</published><updated>2010-08-05T07:21:14.874+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Get a pair that go behind your head</title><content type='html'>Get a pair that go behind your head</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/9015696893538939173/comments/default/8323147840760098320'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/9015696893538939173/comments/default/8323147840760098320'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-headphones.html?showComment=1280855865475#c8323147840760098320' title=''/><author><name>Robot</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/05838102626356475373</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/07/on-headphones.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-9015696893538939173' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/9015696893538939173' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1655518386'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='03 August, 2010 19:17'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-1053820005968956142</id><published>2010-08-05T08:19:00.548+02:00</published><updated>2010-08-05T08:19:00.548+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Lol...

People love to indicate to the right when going around a circle, but since a circle only goes right, the only indication that should be used is left, when one is leaving the circle. I argue with people on many occasions about this, they seem to think if you&amp;#39;re using the exit to the right of the circle (from your perspective) then they should indicate right. This makes no sense. The people waiting to enter the circle want to know if you&amp;#39;re exiting, not if you&amp;#39;re going to continue right. If that person has just approached the circle and you&amp;#39;ve already entered, right indicator flashing away, how are they supposed to know you&amp;#39;re exiting here or elsewhere? Ridiculous logic.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/6128836691067166992/comments/default/2566043717542190636'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/6128836691067166992/comments/default/2566043717542190636'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/02/on-traffic-circles.html?showComment=1298897899875#c2566043717542190636' title=''/><author><name>Robot</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/05838102626356475373</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='https://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/02/on-traffic-circles.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-6128836691067166992' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7253891661294505258/posts/default/6128836691067166992' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1655518386'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='28 February, 2011 14:58'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7253891661294505258.post-2947514173863661403</id><published>2011-02-28T15:03:02.683+02:00</published><updated>2011-02-28T15:03:02.683+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>You&amp;#39;re correct, it does make no sense with a r...</title><content type='html'>You&amp;#39;re correct, it does make no sense with a roundabout, especially if there is more than one lane going around or if you can&amp;#39;t see the other side.

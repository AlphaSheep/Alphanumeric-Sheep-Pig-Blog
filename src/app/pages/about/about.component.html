      This is a blog I started in early 2009. At the time I was just going into the final year of my undergraduate degree,
      and was spending my weekends working an incredibly boring retail job. I was in desperate need of a creative outlet.
      I wrote a lot, often just to keep my fingers moving.

      I continued posting regularly as I started my postgraduate studies, and eventually started posting less and less as
      I reached the end of my PhD. The last post was in 2015, but the truth is it ended long before then. This is a quickly
      thrown together website to move the blog away from Google's Blogger, and onto something I have a little more control over.

      Alphanumeric Sheep Pig is little more than three arbitrarily chosen words. Some of the posts are also little more
      than arbitrarily chosen words. If you find yourself reading one of those posts, I apologise for wasting your time.
      Some other posts are a little more interesting. I hope you enjoy those ones.

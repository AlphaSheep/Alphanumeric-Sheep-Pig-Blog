{"id": "on-dota", "title": "On DotA", "content": "Pronounced \u201cdot ay\u201d. Before I get the scrawny pale fanboys bashing down my door, wanting to kill me, I\u2019d like to point out the spelling is 'DotA'. Note the capitalisation of the \u2018A\u2019 and not the \u2018o\u2019 and the \u2018t\u2019. If it was supposed to be pronounced \u2018doter\u2019, as so many think it should, then it would been spelt with a small \u2018a\u2019.<div class=\"readmore\"> If you like to use the argument that it is an abbreviation, and so the 'A' should be a capital letter, then I applaud you. That is correct, and so the correct spelling is \u2018DOTA\u2019 which would be pronounce \u201cdee, oh, tea, ay\u201d. Of course, the \u2018o\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 stand for \u2018of\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019, which are customarily not capitalised in a title, so why should they be capitalised in the abbreviation? I should point out that these words are customarily left out of abbreviations. So, DotA should be correctly abbreviated \u2018DA\u2019. If you wish to pronounce that as a single word, then it would be pronounced \u2018duh\u2019.<br/><br/>However, those that came up with the name decided to spell it \u2018DotA\u2019, and so the correct pronunciation is \u201cdot ay\u201d. I understand that that may not be what was intended, but I\u2019m sorry. You can\u2019t just change the rules of a language to suit yourself.  <br/><br/>(On a side note: Yes, the song does pronounce it 'doter', but they're not singing in English, are they?)</div>", "published": "2009-08-16T15:07:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-16T09:36:35.413000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence"]}

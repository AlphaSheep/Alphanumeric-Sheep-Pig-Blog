In it's place, there are two sets of buttons. The first gives you options to share the post via email, blogger, twitter, facebook or google buzz.<br/><br/>The second gives you the option to like the post on facebook (without posting anything on your wall).<br/><br/>Please use them, as it gives me exposure so that I can get past my current audience of about 20 readers... I promise to try get back to posting in December.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-11-09T13:32:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:23:07.445000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

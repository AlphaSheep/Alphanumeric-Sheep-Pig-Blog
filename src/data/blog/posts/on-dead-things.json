We have assumed almost everything based on a disgusting smell that has been seeping through the ceiling of the main bedroom for over two weeks now. In order to solve the mystery, I was the one who had to go up into the roof.<div class=\"readmore\"> They claimed that it was because I was small and flexible, but I disagree. I am certainly flexible from my martial arts training over the last three and a half years, but I am the second biggest in the family. Anyway, there was no way my mother was going to go up there, and my brother hid himself in his bedroom for the day (the little coward), so I was stuck with it.<br/><br/>Armed with a spray of air freshener and with Vick\u2019s Vaporub spread thickly over my nostril\u2019s, I went up to see what I could find. Needless to say, I found spiders \u2013 big ones and very much alive \u2013 but no rats. Plenty of rat droppings and half eaten rat poison, but no sign of any actual rats. Rats supposedly remove their dead, don\u2019t they? So I left a tub of fabric softener in the hopes that it would absorb the odour (whatever had made it) and made my way down again.<br/><br/>What\u2019s the point in that story? I wish I knew...</div>", "published": "2010-05-24T09:00:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:03:04.336000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["houses"]}

{"id": "on-not-matching-things", "title": "On Not Matching Things", "content": "No doubt you have been in a sleepy mood one day and mistyped your email password, only to be told that your \"username and password do not match\". This happened to me the other day. Unfortunately, I was always taught that you should choose a password that was not the same as your user name. It's more secure that way.<div class=\"readmore\"> For that reason, I have never used Alphanumeric Sheep Pig in any of my passwords.<br/><br/>At first I thought that it might be some new security policy - make the password the same as your email so that it would be unique... Very smart... However, I couldn't access my email in order to change my password to match my username. Frustrated, I realised that this new policy would mean that anyone with your email address would know your password, but I was not prepared to assume that some programmer I have never met would have realised the same thing. As a result, I was beginning to write an angry letter (since I couldn't get into my email) to state exactly what I thought of the idea.<br/><br/>Halfway through the letter, I decided to try logging in again, and this time my password worked. Looking back, I think that perhaps it was trying to tell me that I had entered either the username or password incorrectly, but if that was the case, then surely it would have just said so?<br/></div>", "published": "2011-03-28T07:34:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-05-03T15:03:38.099000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "annoying things", "language"]}

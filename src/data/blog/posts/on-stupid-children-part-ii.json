{"id": "on-stupid-children-part-ii", "title": "On Stupid Children: Part II", "content": "Today I saw a child walking along with a balloon on a stick. They were pushing it along the ground, swinging it from side to side, as one would use a metal detector. The ballon popped, and the child just stood and stared. I'm not sure she understood what had happened.<div class=\"readmore\"> That's OK. The child was very young, maybe three or four years old. It was easy to forgive her. A regular dose of tuna, and she will be okay.<br/><br/>The thing that worried me was the mother. She stared at the balloon with exactly the same expression as the child. To me this really implies that she didn't understand what had happened either. It is her parents that failed by not giving her enough tuna as a child.<br/><br/>Last week, I had first hand experience on the power of tuna. I have been taking tuna oil supplements for a while now, but I decided that stopping for a week wouldn't make any difference. I was wrong. Within one week, I became an outgoing person. It was horrible. I've been back on my tuna for 6 days now, and I've turned back into a quiet nerd. Thank God. I'd hate to have to be talkative for the rest of my life.</div>", "published": "2009-02-14T18:29:00.008000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-16T09:36:35.466000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "tuna", "stereotypes"]}

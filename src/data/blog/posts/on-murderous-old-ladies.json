{"id": "on-murderous-old-ladies", "title": "On Murderous Old Ladies", "content": "My mother is a big fan of detective stories. She loves reading mystery novels and watching crime dramas on TV. One show she has been watching recently is <i>Midsomer Murders</i>, and she really enjoys it. I, on the other hand, find that sort of show rather disturbing.<div class=\"readmore\"> People complain about crime here in South Africa, but the crime in the county of Midsomer is really out of control. It is a quiet county, mostly populated by little old ladies who would list their hobbies as knitting, gardening and drinking tea, yet their murder rate has to be one of the highest in the world.<br/><br/>Somewhat more disturbing is the show <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>. This follows an old lady who travels around the world. Where ever she goes, people are murdered with alarming regularity... through a total of 243 episodes, each containing at least one murder. Surely a person with such a reputation should be prevented from travelling. No one is safe with people like that out there.</div>", "published": "2010-01-17T15:12:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:01:53.399000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["people"]}

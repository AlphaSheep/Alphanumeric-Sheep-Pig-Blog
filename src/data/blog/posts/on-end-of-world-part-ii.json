You may think that we had a narrow escape, but I have found that my fridge is ever so slightly colder than I thought it was set to - clearly evidence that the penguins have been using it as a hideout.<div class=\"readmore\"> <br/><br/>More importantly, according to Harold Camping, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_end_times_prediction\">the world is going to come to an end on Friday</a> (just before supper, unfortunately), so I thought I'd be nice and help set the mood for our impending doom. I have arranged a nice depressing soundtrack to the end of the world so that, just in case the world does end, we will be in the right mood for it.<br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The Alphanumeric Sheep Pig's Soundtrack to the End of the World</span><br/><br/><ol><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsouEMV4Pb8\">Gustav Mahler - Symphony No. 5, I.

And don't forget to have a good meal beforehand, because if Mr Camping is correct, you won't get another meal again, ever.<br/><br/>(Some rather irrelevant notes: My apologies to those who do not share my taste in music. If I were a video game character, I'd be the little guy on the second island of <i>Black &amp; White</i>, who wanders around in the mountains cheerfully whistling Chopin's Funeral March. The final two movements of the <i>Symphony of the Enchanted Lands</i> are far too uplifting to be included in this list (plus, they'd make it too long to fit on a single CD). Even though I am not American, <i>Taps</i> has an emotional depth that <i>Last Post</i> can never have, no matter how well it's played (I don't think my grandfather would like me saying this though). And then, obviously, I do not claim in any way that these videos or the music therein are my own.)<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2011-10-17T16:30:00+02:00", "updated": "2013-02-28T10:39:22.484000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["music", "those damn penguins"]}

There\u2019s not really much you can say about zombie rodents, apart from the fact that they\u2019d behave very much like normal rodents, except maybe they'd move a bit slower (and be easier to catch). And maybe they'd drop a limb or two here and there...<div class=\"readmore\"> Think about, rats are pretty much your most zombie-like creatures already. Actually, don\u2019t think about it, because then you\u2019ll realise what a load of nonsense I\u2019m actually talking.<br/><br/>The most zombie-like creature is actually a shark. It thinks \u201cfoooood\u201d and starts mindlessly following one target, but it\u2019s easily distracted if it passes more food and it will start mindlessly following that one instead. But the shark is driven by pure instinct, which brings me back to the rodents. The whole reason behind rats being used in labs to test behaviour is that they are predictable animals that are driven by pure instinct. If you train a rat to do something, it will do it.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the zombies. Consider a zombie human. It is simply a mindless being which is driven entirely by its instinct to find \u201cbraaaaiins\u201d. I\u2019m curious as to how easy it would be to use this zombie instinct to train it to follow mazes and the like. Would it be possible to insert electrodes into a zombies head and trigger automatic responses? Does anyone know where I could get hold of a couple of zombies so I can try this out? Although, now that I think of it, maybe building cyborg zombies is just asking for trouble.</div>", "published": "2010-06-15T07:27:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:03:04.334000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology"]}

{"id": "on-libraries", "title": "On Libraries", "content": "The university recently changed the library system. Not really \u2013 it\u2019s still the same system, but they have made changes to how it is accessed. Previously, there were several computers, logged on to the university\u2019s intranet, with a search page open for so that anyone could simply type in a couple of keywords, click search, and would be given a list of books, showing whether these books were available or not, and if they were, then where they could be found. If you knew what you were looking for, it took less than thirty seconds to find the book.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>The new system uses the same computers and the same intranet site. The catch is that the computers are not logged on. Each student has a username and password, and must log on to the computer. They then need to wait while the operating system loads up, and then open the internet browser. They then need to type in the address of the search site, and wait for that to load. Only then can they search for the book. The whole process only takes a couple of minutes, but it\u2019s still four times longer than the old system. <br/><br/>I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to go through third year with that system. I remember running to the library during a tea break, since lectures ran from eight to five \u2013 the only time the library was open. I typed in a couple of keywords to find a general range of shelf numbers, and grabbed four or five random books with relevant titles, so that I could page through them at home that evening. I feel sorry for all future generations of third years\u2026<br/><br/>The idea must have been put in their heads by the penguins.</div>", "published": "2009-08-30T13:25:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:10:52.792000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "incompetence", "those damn penguins", "libraries"]}

I spent a full twenty-or-so minutes setting up a website some time last week, and after registering a domain, and spending several days procrastinating, it is on-line. You should find the official website at <a href=\"http://www.amusinghatday.za.org\">www.amusinghatday.za.org</a> without having to do too much searching.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>If you enjoy using the <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">Short-Spam-Engine</a>, then you can follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AmusingHatDay\">@AmusingHatDay</a> on twitter. And of course, if you haven't already done so, then RSVP to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=189954341040978\">Facebook event</a>.<br/><br/>If you still haven't thought of what hat you are going to wear, then consider one of the following: underwear; a pot plant; a cardboard box; a brick (if you have strong neck muscles); an inside out T-shirt; a wooden plank; a plastic cup (I would not recommend glass); a small electric appliance; a book (an old boring one that no one would want to read, preferably); or a plastic bag (don't suffocate yourself though).<br/><br/>If you have any ideas that are not listed here, then feel free to suggest them in the comments.<br/><br/>Feel free to send an email to the event organisers at <a href=\"mailto:amusinghat@alphasheep.co.za\">amusinghat@alphasheep.co.za</a>.<br/></div>", "published": "2011-08-08T17:35:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-03-13T21:42:19.042000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "Amusing Hat Day"]}

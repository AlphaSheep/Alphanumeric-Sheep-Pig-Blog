This annoys me because I can, and it\u2019s really not that difficult.<div class=\"readmore\"> Just because your calculator can't do it doesn't mean it's impossible.<br/><br/>You may be expecting a warning about here about high mathematical content, but you\u2019re not going to get one. The reason I decided to leave it out is because I don\u2019t regard this as high level maths at all. In fact, it\u2019s pretty fundamental. The average child will have zero covered in maths at school at around the age of seven, and should learn the basics of division at the age of nine. Therefore, I expect the average nine year old to be able to divide by zero.<br/><br/>All you need to get your head around is the fact that there are different types of zero. For example, even though 2 times zero is still zero, it\u2019s a different zero. In fact, it\u2019s twice the first zero, even though it is given the same zero, but this only becomes relevant in a couple of special cases...<br/><br/>In general, a positive number divided by zero gives infinity. A negative number can be made positive by taking out the negative. Zero divided by zero depends on the origin of the zero, so if you take the first zero in the previous paragraph and divide it by the second zero, you\u2019d get a half. Since it\u2019s not usually as simple as that, you\u2019d simply apply L\u2019Hopital\u2019s Rule, which does require some elementary differential calculus, but it\u2019s really not that hard. <br/><br/>Hopefully the world's so-called \u201cgeeks\u201d and \u201cnerds\u201d will read this and stop making such a big thing out of zero...</div>", "published": "2010-04-25T15:18:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2011-05-03T15:02:47.721000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "annoying things", "mathematics"]}

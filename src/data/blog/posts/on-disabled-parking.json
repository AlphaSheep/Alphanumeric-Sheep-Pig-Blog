When I was in high school, I injured my knee quite badly in a hockey game, and I landed up on crutches for a while. Looking back at that time, I sympathise with disabled people and the elderly who have difficulty walking, and I understand why the best parking spaces are reserved for them. What I don\u2019t understand is why people who can\u2019t walk altogether and need wheelchairs are allowed to park there. Especially those people who use electric wheelchairs.<br/><br/>It takes far more effort for me to walk from the furthest parking space to the entrance than it does for someone to simply hold a lever forward until he gets there.<br/><br/>I think that the furthest parking space in each parking lot should be made 50% wider, and reserved for wheelchair users. It\u2019s time they stopped being so lazy and let the real crippled people use the parking spaces that were intended for them.</div>", "published": "2009-09-13T13:12:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2011-09-19T12:42:47.117000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["traffic", "chairs"]}

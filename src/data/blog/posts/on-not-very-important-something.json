Being at work with a limited range of tools at my disposal, I simple did a Google image search, stole a cartoonish picture of a sheep, sent it through an online image to ASCII art converter, and then used that as my logo, meaning to change it at a later date to something a bit more complicated. But I liked the way it had turned out, and being a chronic procrastinator, I never got round to making an original one.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"data/images/AkM4LuD72Eo.jpg\" width=\"362\"/></div><br/>After posting about having been going for two years, I remembered that I was going to make a new logo. With almost non-existent graphic design skills, and minimal artistic talent, I opened up GIMP and created a new image... After half an hour of getting nothing, I Googled \u201csheep\u201d and there was an inquisitive sheep staring back at me. Gradually over the next 5 hours, I focussed removing each part of the sheep, and replaced it with planes of text with a perspective effect, and added a piggy nose. And so, I introduce the new Alphanumeric Sheep Pig.<br/><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"data/images/NM9BlRfU9Mw.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></div></div>", "published": "2011-01-19T07:56:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T13:35:55.211000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

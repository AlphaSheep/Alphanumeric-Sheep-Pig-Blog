It always used to annoy me (actually, it still does) how teachers say \u201cYou can\u2019t add apples and oranges\u201d to children to make sure they have consistent units.<div class=\"readmore\"> I understand what they want to say (that you can\u2019t add one minute to one hour and get two of anything), but I disagree with the way they say it.<br/><br/>The problem is, if I have two apples and three oranges, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to add them together, and say I had five pieces of fruit. This was drilled into me by my parents, who would often say to me when I was a child, \u201cNo more, you\u2019ve already had five sweets.\u201d Even though I\u2019d actually only had one fizzer, two toffees and two sparkles, and of course, those can\u2019t be added together.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-12-06T18:51:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:58:43.561000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["annoying things", "mathematics", "food"]}

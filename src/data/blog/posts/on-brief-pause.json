Perhaps not, because this blog was born out of boredom anyway (or at least, an excuse not to do any work). I apologise to those people who come back each week and were disappointed, but it goes to show how an unintentional pattern forms, and then everyone spots a pattern that was never meant to be there in the first place, and they start to follow it.<div class=\"readmore\"> It maybe my fault for adding a few posts almost every Sunday for almost ten months. Anyway, I am still here, still alive (although now part cyborg), and I may have a few posts left in me.<br/><br/>Three weeks? Is that all. Here I was thinking I'd been away for 70% of the month.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wish I could say I had a backlog of topics, but I don't, so you'll have to put up with slightly fewer posts than you were getting earlier in the year. But then again, you don't have a choice, do you? Hehe.</div>", "published": "2009-11-29T12:29:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:06:18.263000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

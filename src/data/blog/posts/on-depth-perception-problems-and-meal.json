It\u2019s just one of those things... I\u2019ve never really been able to tell the difference between a small object close up and a big object far away.<div class=\"readmore\"> I never saw the fascination of those stereoscopic binoculars that were popular back in the early \u201890s (those ones with the two little cardboard wheels with frames of Spiderman or something printed on rectangles of transparent plastic arranged around the rim). And those 3D images where you squint and see a 3D image jump out of the page. Those never worked for me. And this new fascination with 3D films, I just don\u2019t get. To me, it looks the same, and I just get a headache. It\u2019s a minor disability, and I just couldn\u2019t care less... usually...<br/><br/>The only thing that does bother me about it is that I cannot judge the size of a plate. This is not a problem for foods that are a pretty standard size, like sandwiches, but for other foods it becomes a major problem. If the plate is slightly smaller than usual, I land up dishing up less food than I\u2019d like. That\u2019s not so bad, provided I can go back for a second helping. The problem is when the plate is big (or square \u2013 I have great difficulty judging the size of a square plate, and I almost always get it wrong). With a big plate, I always land up with more food than I want. I don\u2019t like this, because having a plate that isn\u2019t completely empty being taken away from me is something that really bugs me... Even a couple of crumbs get on my nerves.<br/><br/>Just thought I\u2019d say it... Don\u2019t worry. Just try not to think of me having a normal driver\u2019s license and driving on the same roads as everyone else...<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-06-22T08:26:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:37:27.575000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["food"]}

Which I did promise to write about ages ago, even though there\u2019s not too much to say about them. Apart from pointing them out, of course.<div class=\"readmore\"> Those with visual imaginations can draw up a mental image of this mildly retarded event, and have a little chuckle. Those who do not have visual imaginations can just say it really quickly, trip over the alliteration, and other people can have a little chuckle at you. All round everyone (generally regarded as some people) wins (provided they are prepared to lower their standards... such that a win can be regarded as anything that is not last place).<br/><br/>The nice thing about writing is that it encourages people to use their imaginations... which is to say, I\u2019ve just saved myself several hours of developing a 3D animation of spiders on a snowy slope, which would only provide a few seconds of amusement to my audience. Instead, I can spend a few seconds writing a sentence, and provide the audience with the same (albeit somewhat devalued) few seconds of entertainment, thereby improving efficiency a thousandfold.</div>", "published": "2010-02-07T15:03:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T12:58:47.227000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

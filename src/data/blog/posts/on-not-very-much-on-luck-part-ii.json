{"id": "on-not-very-much-on-luck-part-ii", "title": "On Not Very Much On Luck Part II", "content": "We have a garden service that comes every now and then to spray our lawn to kill the weeds. First they spray a liquid fertiliser, which makes the weeds grow like crazy, and then they come back a week later, and spray poison on the weeds.<div class=\"readmore\"> It used to be really effective, but not so much anymore. They came three weeks ago, and the weeds are already coming back. Especially the clovers.<br/><br/>I\u2019m starting to wonder; maybe the clovers are growing immune to the poison. Maybe the poison is just making them mutate. I hust happened to glance at the ground, and I found my second four leaf clover in the space of six days. Once again it led to something big happening that I guess could be attributed to luck. I thought that maybe all the clovers had four leaves, but they did not. The one I found was the only one. Maybe I\u2019m just extremely lucky.<br/><br/>I wonder when the neighbourhood will start getting three eyed cats wondering around.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-10-02T09:07:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:59:14.496000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["luck"]}

{"id": "on-blue-monkey", "title": "On Google and the Blue Monkey", "content": "Regular followers of my blog will know that I have a fascination with appearing in Google\u2019s searches. As a person who spends a lot of time searching Google for scientific content, with in depth explanations. More technical than what a high school or first year student would be looking for. And I am almost always disappointed.<div class=\"readmore\"> (My fellow students will understand how useless Google actually is if you aren\u2019t just an average bored person, or twelve year old with a project for school.<br/><br/>When I eventually worked out that there are far better ways to get quality information that is accurate and reliable, I decided that I\u2019d feed those poor unfortunate Google users with the information they want. Please don\u2019t misunderstand this. I am a nice person. I am not aiming to get onto Google searches just to be a pain in the neck. Where ever possible, I\u2019d like to bring those ignorant people the information that they want.<br/><br/>Google includes an extremely useful feature for web site owners, called \u201cGoogle Webmaster Tools\u201d. It allows users to see what Google searches return my blog in the results, and which of these actually led people to click a link to my blog. It is remarkably interesting how little information is on Google if you see the sorts of searches that will put me near the top of the results.<br/><br/>In particular is a search \u201cblue monkey wikipedia\u201d which returned my blog on the first page. Naturally, I was curious and did some research. The blue monkey (or diademed monkey) is in fact a silver and gray monkey that can be found in Eastern and Central Africa. It\u2019s interesting that the vervet monkey which is very common in South Africa is called a blouapie in Afrikaans (translated literally as \u201cblue monkey\u201d). This is a completely different type of monkey. The truth is that neither monkey is actually blue, which just goes to reaffirm that biologists have no clue about the real world.<br/><br/>Another one that I am particularly proud of is that a search for \u201cflapping flight\u201d returns my blog as number 176 on the list. (I have not verified this.) The reason that I\u2019m proud of it is that it\u2019s a field I\u2019m really interested in. If anyone really is interested in this from a scientific or engineering point of view, I refer you to the work of Ansari et.al. who seems to have the best mathematical model. They approximate the wing by a thin cambered Joukowsky airfoil, and use potential flow theory to model the unsteady flow over the wings. The analysis is extended into three dimensions by considering the vortex and wake interactions as the wings flap. He then uses a momentum based method to extract the forces and moments on the wings, and presents them in two neat little vector integral equations.

If they are possible, then they are almost certainly sterile and pointless. A half pig half sheep would be stupid idea. I think you should be far more worried about a half sheep half jaguar. They would look like fluffy white (very much) overgrown domestic cats, until you get too close, and they pounce on you.<br/><br/>The other thing that concerns me is that there really is such a thing as a blue potato.</div>", "published": "2009-06-07T16:38:00.008000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:16:12.396000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["Google", "domesticated animals"]}

It does, however, take two or three minutes to kick in. Every night, I lie in bed on my left hand side, and my digital clock stares at me from across the room. It may be weird, but in those last few moments before I fall asleep, I see faces in the clock.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>It\u2019s the colon in the middle that does it, I think. Especially since, normally, when I go to bed, the clock reads 21 something. The two little lines of the one make straight eyebrows above the little beady eyes, and the two forms a wavy hairstyle. Most of the time, the face just stares at me both noseless and expressionless, or has an open mouth, gaping in shock, possibly at its oddly shaped chin which twists its shape every minute.<br/><br/>What amazes me most is after half past, the way a face with huge flaring nostrils, sticking it tongue out at me at 21:36 can suddenly transform into a face with a long thin nose and a curly mustache and a neat collar by 21:37.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-10-11T17:27:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:59:07.232000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["time"]}

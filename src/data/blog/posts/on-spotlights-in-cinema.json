{"id": "on-spotlights-in-cinema", "title": "On Spotlights in the Cinema", "content": "Movie tickets are getting expensive these days. Actually, not really. At most places they are pretty cheap. Where they are still expensive, they\u2019re not much more than they were five years ago, so there\u2019s not really much point in complaining. My complaint is actually not so much about the prices, but about some of the people who pay that price.<div class=\"readmore\"> I\u2019m not sure why they do, because it\u2019s cheaper (actually free) to sit outside. That\u2019s much better than paying to be in the cinema when you\u2019re just going to play on your cell phone. Or sit on MXit or Facebook, and not pay any attention to the screen.<br/><br/>The stupidest part about it all is that people think no one will notice, but then if they are looking for something in the dark, the first thing half of them do is pull out their cell phone to serve as a light. Why don\u2019t they just take a torch to the cinema and shine that around.</div>", "published": "2009-11-01T14:28:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-16T09:36:35.395000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "incompetence"]}

From time\u2019s reference frame, if you were to start off in the future and move to the past, then you\u2019ll have moved backwards in time. So far, it\u2019s simple and easy to follow. <div class=\"readmore\"> Now let\u2019s look at it from your reference frame. If time starts off ahead of you, and then flows to behind you, then time is considered to be flowing forwards. If it were to start off behind you and end up ahead of you, it would be said to have flowed backwards. If you start off in yesterday, and moved to tomorrow, you\u2019d have moved forward in time, but if Wednesday, 20 April 2011 were to start off in yesterday and move to tomorrow, then time would have moved backwards. Therefore, time must be facing the opposite direction to you.  <br/><br/></div>", "published": "2011-04-21T08:10:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2012-02-06T12:26:34.072000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["time"]}

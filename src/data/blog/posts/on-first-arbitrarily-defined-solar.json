{"id": "on-first-arbitrarily-defined-solar", "title": "On the First Arbitrarily Defined Solar Cycle", "content": "At 14:38 on Saturday the 17th of January 2009, while I was very bored at work (and it wasn\u2019t even such a slow day) I posted the first ramblings of my overactive imaginations. (Actually not the first... I had a blog before... but I forgot my password... and I forgot where I\u2019d put it.)<div class=\"readmore\"> Since then, the blog has been accessed over 500 times, resulting in over 2000 pages being loaded Not that that\u2019s that impressive... What is impressive is the 87% return rate. Thank you.<br/><br/>I am still impressed with those Americans who find my blog in Google, desperately wanting to know how to get a pig to mate with a sheep, wanting to find out if rabbits can eat chicken, or paranoid that ants are busy eating their houses out from under them, or wanting to know if squirrels lay eggs. I hope all your questions were answered... But it's not just them. It's people from all over the world. Here's a nice map of the visitors over the last couple of months. The Brazilians seem to have drifted off... and I'm still waiting for China and Japan to find me, but otherwise, I'm pretty proud of myself.<br/><br/><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img ps=\"true\" src=\"data/images/PsGAvjkyPGc.jpg\"/></div><br/>Hopefully I\u2019ll have something about those slightly stupid spiders in slippers sliding into stuff while spinning in the snow on slippery slopes soon, but it seems to be taking a while. Other than that, I hope I\u2019m bored enough to keep this going for another year, but not so bored that my imagination falls asleep again... I swear, it must be related to one of the penguin mafia\u2019s evil plots.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-01-17T12:33:00.007000+02:00", "updated": "2012-01-17T07:48:24.004000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["those damn penguins", "houses", "land marks"]}

Normally, one side is marked with a little \"+\", so I just match that one up with the \"+\" on the object.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>The other day, I was replacing the battery in a microphone, and I checked the side to look for the little \"+\". It wasn't there. Instead, the manufacturers had decided to put a little diagram explaining which was positive, and which was negative. Instead of simply matching the \"+\" signs (which has by now become an automatic reaction), I have to look at the diagram, think about its meaning, look at the top and determine which terminal is which. It really is a waste of thought.</div>", "published": "2009-02-14T12:15:00.009000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T16:03:04.370000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "engineering"]}

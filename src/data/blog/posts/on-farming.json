Does this qualify me as an avo farmer?<div class=\"readmore\"> My first instinct was no, because none of them actually provide me with food (In fact, only three have even started to show signs of rooting so far), but that got me thinking. What actually defines a farmer? If I went and bought 100 hectares of land, ploughed it all up and sowed seeds, then there would be no doubt that I\u2019m a farmer... If I have ten avo trees germinating in my house, am I a farmer?<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-09-01T16:00:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:24:15.817000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["people", "philosophy"]}

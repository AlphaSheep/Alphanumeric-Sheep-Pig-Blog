Ten years ago, people would have said \u201ctaking a long-term view\u201d, but over the last few months, people have started saying \u201clooking at things going forward\u201d. It\u2019s strange watching language evolve right in front of your eyes.<div class=\"readmore\"> I understand that it is the popular way to put it at the moment, and that it\u2019s trying to sound modern, but it really does sound like they\u2019re adapting their speech for a <a href=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish\">Wikipedia Simple English</a> article.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve always wondered how these things started out. I can see one person in an office who wants to sound modern and different. (Probably the guy who\u2019s away every second week on a \u201ceffective management\u201d course, and not embarrassed to wear a bright yellow shirt to a meeting. He doesn\u2019t wear ties, but if he did, it would probably be neon purple. In other words, the attention seeker.) He\u2019s sick of hearing everyone using the same words, so he comes up with a new way of saying something, just to sound different. Because its so funny, everyone starts mimicking it, and before they know it, they start using his words unintentionally. At first it is \u201cBob in the corner office\u201d who has the weird way of talking. Then suddenly it\u2019s \u201cthose guys in marketing\u201d, then \u201cthose guys on the seventh floor\u201d. For a brief time, it becomes \u201cthose guys at head office\u201d, and then suddenly, no one notices any more since it\u2019s the accepted way. Suddenly, the previous term sounds old fashioned.<br/><br/>(On a side note: This whole idea of a large group picking up a mannerism from some one else happens all the time. In third year, we had a lecturer who ended every sentence with a \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018of\u2019. He had very good technical English, and would give a clear and well structured sentence and end off with an \u2018of\u2019. \u201cThe controller sends a 24V signal which triggers the contactor, and this switches off the motor of.\u201d I can\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t funny, and in time, some of my classmates (me included) found ourselves doing it occasionally. It took a couple of months to lose the habit.)</div>", "published": "2009-09-20T12:48:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:21:26.321000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["language", "stereotypes"]}

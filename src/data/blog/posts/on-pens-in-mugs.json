{"id": "on-pens-in-mugs", "title": "On Pens in Mugs", "content": "For some really odd reason (which still evades me), there is a sort of tradition for using mugs as a stationery \u201corganiser\u201d on a desk. I do not like the term \u201corganiser\u201d, since a mug is in no way capable of organising.<div class=\"readmore\"> All the stationery is together and allowed to mix freely. Every time you move the mug even slightly, the pens jump around and rearrange themselves. This is hardly organised. The stationery would be far more organised if it was just laid out on the desk.<br/><br/>Another thing I do not understand is the need for so many pens that they need to be organised. I get by with a single clutch pencil, and a single pen (black, rarely used). The nice thing about having only two of anything is that they are organised even if you get the order back to front. (You can always claim reverse alphabetical order). There are very few jobs which would require more stationery than that, and if they do, that stationery is not normally used often enough to justify the space it takes up on the desk. This stationery should be kept in a drawer \u2013 the correct place for storing stationery.<br/><br/>Honestly, have they not considered what would happen if they were to suddenly want a cup of coffee? They\u2019d have to drink it out of the drawer...</div>", "published": "2010-02-28T15:27:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:00:21.742000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence"]}

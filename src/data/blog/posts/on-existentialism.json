And when last did you read an existentialist text written by a tortoise. To the best of my knowledge, there are none, and tortoises achieve pretty much nothing in life. What are they supposed to do, apart from deep philosophical thinking? And they don\u2019t even bother writing any philosophical essays. I think this gets across the point that writing deep philosophical works is really pointless.<br/><br/>And what does that mean about me? I don\u2019t even think that deeply. Does that make me even more useless than a tortoise? What\u2019s the point in these rhetorical questions? I\u2019m really grateful that I\u2019m so awesome, otherwise I\u2019d have some serious doubts about myself.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-05-18T16:15:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2012-12-19T17:07:31.773000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["philosophy"]}

Not even the four legged kind (or one, three, five or six legged kinds). This is on the two legged kind that oversees a meeting, or a debate, or presentations, or that sort of thing.<div class=\"readmore\"> (Admittedly, the number of legs may be any non-negative integer less than or equal to two, depending on the number and nature of industrial/recreational/motor vehicle accidents the bearer of these legs has been involved in. It may even be more than two, if one considers birth defects. However, they are generally two legged.)<br/><br/>Calling a person a chair is a bit insulting. A chair is a pretty simple thing. It has no thoughts of its own and no personality. I would not like to be called a chair. Why, then, is it customary to call people Mr. or Madame Chair? Why can we not just use their real names like sensible people?<br/><br/>Or can we at least show some respect and call them Mr. Luxury Sofa.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-08-23T13:32:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2013-09-12T12:16:53.013000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "chairs"]}

I\u2019m quite proud of this, since it\u2019s a scientific topic (probably from a 10 year old, but still). The answer is quite simply zero.<div class=\"readmore\"> Once it has landed, it has no kinetic energy. If we\u00a0change the question slightly, and\u00a0consider a pencil\u00a0an instant before it lands on the carpet, things become\u00a0a bit more interesting.\u00a0Neglecting air friction, and assuming an average sized wooden pencil dropped from an average table, you\u2019re looking at about 30 mJ, or in imperial units, 0.007 cal. If you\u2019re looking at the explosive energy (as in kiloton explosive), it\u2019s about 7 millionths of a gram. Not very worthwhile, if you ask me. If you want to drop a decent amount of kinetic energy on your carpet, consider dropping a truck off a cliff.<br/><br/>Taking air resistance\u00a0into account (since I have no excuses), you\u2019ll have a Reynold\u2019s number of about 2000 (at sea level on a slightly warm day), nowhere near enough to cause turbulence in the boundary layer, and lose about 0.7 mJ if the pencil falls sideward. If the pencil falls point down, then your Reynold\u2019s number is a bit higher at 40000, which means you\u2019ve got slightly less skin friction. Not to mention that the pressure drag is way down. If that happens, you only lose about 0.1 mJ of kinetic energy.<br/><br/>I bet your Google search didn\u2019t tell you that\u2026 all you would have found, if you\u00a0fixed up your search,\u00a0was the good old Ek = \u00bd.m.v^2 and Ep = m.g.h formulae.</div>", "published": "2009-09-20T18:58:00.007000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:15:55.121000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["pencil", "engineering", "Google"]}

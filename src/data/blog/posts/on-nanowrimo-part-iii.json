{"id": "on-nanowrimo-part-iii", "title": "On NaNoWriMo Part III", "content": "As I did last year, I will be taking part in <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/dashboard\">National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)</a>. For the month of November, I will be attempting to write a fifty thousand word novel. In the mean time, you can keep yourself occupied by reading <a href=\"http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2010/12/on-nanowrimo-part-ii-on-barghest.html\">what I managed to write last year</a>. Or, you could always just use the time you normally spend browsing pointless stuff on the internet (like right now) to be constructive and write a novel.<br/><br/>You can keep track of the progress of my novel <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/participants/alphanumericsheeppig/novels/type-iv\">here</a>. Feel free to add me as a writing buddy if you're also doing it. I will be back with a novel for you (or at least part of one) in early December.<br/><br/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"data/images/ztUdBBCt4EQ.png\"/><br/></div>", "published": "2011-10-31T10:11:00+02:00", "updated": "2011-12-01T09:03:37.205000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["NaNoWriMo"]}

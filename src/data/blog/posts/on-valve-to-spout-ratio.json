And which may be one or two, depending on the bath/basin/sink layout, design and relative laziness of the plumber who did the installation. The ratio has little importance in a bath, since the water mixes anyway.<div class=\"readmore\"> It is also of little significance if there is only a single valve (as any additional spouts would be redundant), but in the case of separate hot and cold taps on a sink or basin, the ratio should in all cases, without exception, be 2:1. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in all of the basins I regularly encounter, there is a 1:1 ratio of taps to spouts. If you need to wash your hands quickly, it is impractical to fill the basin (not to mention that filling the basin wastes water). Thus, holding your hands under the tap becomes the most practical solution. The problem with having a 1:1 valve to spout ratio with separate hot and cold valves is that no mixing would take place. The water from the hot spout is too hot, and water from the cold spout is too cold. My solution to this is often to have both taps on and dart between the hot and cold streams. This is an unnecessary waste of water that would be solved so easily by increasing the valve to spout ratio.<br/><br/>Conservation of water should be our number one priority. If we\u2019re not careful, the penguins will have solidified all of it in their Antarctic ice factories and we will have none.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-07-23T08:47:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-09-12T12:36:25.077000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["engineering", "incompetence", "those damn penguins"]}

{"id": "on-functional-structure-of-pen", "title": "On Functional Structure of a Pen", "content": "One of the biggest downfalls of the modern design of the pen is that more than two thirds of the pen sticks out of your hand when you use it. I have never really understood why this is necessary, and the designers of modern pens should be ashamed of themselves.<div class=\"readmore\"> When an engineer designs an aircraft, every effort is made to remove unnecessary weight. Any structure that does not carry out a function that is absolutely critical to the safe operation of the aircraft is left out.<br/><br/>I decided to apply my engineering knowledge to make modifications to a pen, in order to eliminate some of the useless components. I identified the function that a pen is required to fulfil, and noted that 55% of the structure and 25% of the mechanical components played no part in fulfilling this function.<br/><br/>With the aid of a concrete floor, a shoe and some sticky tape, I managed to make the necessary modifications to make a 45% weight saving on the pen, while increasing its effectiveness by 15%, and reliability by 50%.<br/><br/><img alt=\"The only problem with it is that the tape slips because the spring needs to be compressed 15% further to make it louder...\" src=\"data/images/4T07GAMBDSw.jpg\"/><br/><br/>It clicks louder, and fits perfectly in my pocket, and that other bit that sticks out of my hand is no longer a problem, and it has a 0% chance of leaking. (I could never work out why they needed to put a tube filled with ink in pens anyway)</div>", "published": "2009-05-24T14:50:00.008000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:00:21.744000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["engineering"]}

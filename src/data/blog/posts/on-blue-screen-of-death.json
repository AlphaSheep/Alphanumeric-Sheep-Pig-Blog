Not angry \u2013 I hardly ever actually get angry, but I do sometimes get frustrated. Over the past couple of years, I have instead started to sympathise with my poor computer in these moments.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>I\u2019ve always had those weird moments where I walk all the way across the house to fetch something, and then stand there like an idiot when I realise that I\u2019ve forgotten what I walked all that way for. It\u2019s exactly the same as when you stand at the ATM and realise you\u2019ve forgotten your bank PIN \u2013 the same number you use several times a month. And those times you try to remember a word or a person\u2019s name that you use regularly. I seem to be getting these moments far too often these days, and it has shown me how the computer must feel. They are just memory faults, and that\u2019s exactly what causes the blue screen. It\u2019s just the computers way of suddenly stopping and saying \u201cUh, what was I doing?\u201d<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-05-24T08:42:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:36:01.298000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "annoying things"]}

{"id": "on-biggest-gap-in-english-language", "title": "On the Biggest Gap in the English Language", "content": "Feminists over recent years have successfully destroyed a vitally important part of the English language, and offered no replacement. English no longer has a gender-neutral singular reference pronoun. Until a few years ago, this role was taken up the word \u2018he\u2019, as in \u201cAnyone can do what he wants.\u201d<div class=\"readmore\"> Now, the meaning of \u2018he\u2019 has been limited to male only. The need to constantly replace \u2018he\u2019 with the extremely clumsy \u2018he or she\u2019 led to the use of the multiple reference, but gender-neutral pronoun \u2018they\u2019.<br/><br/>However, this is not technically correct, as the statement \u201cAnyone can do what they want\u201d implies multiple subjects. This would lead to the more important singular generalization pronouns \u2018anyone\u2019, \u2018everybody\u2019 and \u2018someone\u2019, amongst others, to become multiple generalization pronouns. This means that anyone who asks for something would in fact be several people asking for lots of that thing, and life would suddenly get a lot more confusing.<br/><br/>It is so much simpler if singular and plural are kept separate, and a new gender-neutral singular reference pronoun is introduced. I propose the phrase \u2018gender-neutral singular reference\u2019 to prevent further confusion. As in \u201cAnyone can do what gender-neutral singular reference wants.\u201d That is perfectly clear and will not offend anyone.</div>", "published": "2009-04-26T19:28:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T15:41:16.874000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["language"]}

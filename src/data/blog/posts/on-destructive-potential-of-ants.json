They're gone now, but I still can't help thinking about them.<div class=\"readmore\"> Ants are quite similar to termites in many ways. If you live in a wooden house, and your house becomes infested with termites, you have a serious problem. Termites eat wood.<br/><br/>But I don't live in a wooden house. And ants don't eat wood. As far as I can tell, they eat leaves, other insects, and chocolate, and cake, and almost anything else. But not wood. That eased my fears a little, until one day in the kitchen cupboard, I noticed a line of ants crawling out of a hole in the wall. Ants don't eat wood, or bricks, but they do dig. Brick and cement are no obstacle to them. That got me wondering. Could ants dig through a house until the point that it collapses. And how do I know how many holes are running through my wall. Do architects think of that sort of thing?</div>", "published": "2009-02-14T13:11:00.011000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:06:26.916000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["houses"]}

{"id": "on-pointing-things-out", "title": "On Pointing Things Out", "content": "My mind is quite simple. It can only focus on a very limited number of things at a time. I also think very deeply, and slowly, and when I do, I am essentially disconnected from the outside world. Because of this, I usually don\u2019t notice something until its pointed out.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>When winter gets going, I don\u2019t notice the weather changing. I wake up each morning, and get dressed for summer. Yes, it might be cold then, and it probably is, but how am I supposed to know. I don\u2019t religiously watch weather reports or read thermometers. (I actually do have a thermometer next to my bed, but apart from a midsummer evening (when it is accurate to within 2\u00b0C) it says nothing more than too hot or too cold. The problem is that it\u2019s been there for the last ten years, so I don\u2019t notice it anymore.) Several hours later someone asks me, \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and then I\u2019m shivering for the rest of the day.<br/><br/>People that point things out are very inconsiderate.<br/><br/>They are doing road works late at night not that far from my house. If the wind is just right (which it has been for the last couple of weeks), then the beeping of reversing trucks travels through the air and reaches my house. It\u2019s actually quite loud, but I didn\u2019t notice until my mother mentioned that she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep for two nights because of it. Of course, that night, I kept hearing the beeping. (Luckily, it didn\u2019t affect my sleep. I could sleep through the end of the world.)<br/><br/>People shouldn\u2019t point out annoying things. Wait\u2026 I do that all the time, don\u2019t I?<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-09-20T14:49:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:08:06.528000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["people", "annoying things", "weather"]}

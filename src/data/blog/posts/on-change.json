{"id": "on-change", "title": "On Change", "content": "Managing a store is hard work. One of the most annoying problems is trying to maintain the cash float. Despite the fact that it is more convenient to have fewer notes of large denominations in a wallet than to have more notes of smaller denominations, most people are too lazy to count their money, and will hand over a large note and accept the change.<div class=\"readmore\"> It\u2019s quite frustrating, because the float is only so much, and it\u2019s quite a bit of effort to go get change for the larger notes. It\u2019s not difficult, but it just takes for more energy from me, than it would take for a customer to count his money. You have to think of energy efficiency on a global scale. When you say \u201cDon\u2019t you have any change?\u201d, its amazing how many customers will produce the exact amount.</div>", "published": "2009-07-12T18:31:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-05-03T15:02:47.734000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "shopping", "annoying things"]}

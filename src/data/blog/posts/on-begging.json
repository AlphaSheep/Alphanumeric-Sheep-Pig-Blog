{"id": "on-begging", "title": "On Begging", "content": "I don\u2019t often give money to beggars on the side of the road, for a number of reasons. The fact that I don\u2019t earn very much money myself does play a bit of a role, but I think the biggest factor is that I don\u2019t get much out of it. People say you should do it to feel good, to get the \u201cwarm fuzzy feeling\u201d. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t get those feelings.<div class=\"readmore\"> Maybe it makes me a horrible person, but I really don\u2019t care. They say I should do it to make a difference in the world. I agree, it is possible to make a difference, bit by bit. But do I really want to encourage the idea that you can make money by doing nothing? A world where those who earn lose everything and those who don\u2019t get given everything for free is not really a world I want to live in.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not trying to discourage you from giving. If you do, then good for you. Please carry on. I\u2019d hate to see people starve because of something I\u2019ve said.<br/><br/>A week or two ago, I saw a beggar that I had to give money to. It was a teenager wearing tattered clothes, and barefoot on the hot tar. He was carrying a worn cardboard sign, reading \u201cNo food, no job. Seven children to feed, and all my girlfriends and both wives are pregnant. Please help.\u201d As he passed my car, I watched him in the rear-view mirror. The back of his sign read \u201cMy dog ate my brother\u2019s soccer boots and got arrested. I need money for the bail. Please help.\u201d Whoever he is, even if he's a multi-millionaire, he deserves every cent he was given.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-10-04T13:44:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2013-09-12T12:50:42.530000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

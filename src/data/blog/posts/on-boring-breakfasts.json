{"id": "on-boring-breakfasts", "title": "On Boring Breakfasts", "content": "I know that breakfast is (allegedly) the most important meal of the day, but I have come to the point where I no longer feel the need to eat breakfast. The problem is that I eat the same thing for breakfast every single day, and I\u2019m really bored of it. I\u2019ve tried alternating a few things, but when you look at it, all breakfasts are the same.<div class=\"readmore\"> It\u2019s all either cereals or porridge, since I really don\u2019t have the time to fry bacon and eggs. All porridges are the same, and cereals always go soggy, and after that, they always taste the same. Coco Pops are awesome for the first month or so, but after that, they're just soggy Rice Crispies in overly sweet slightly chocolate flavoured milk. The problem is that if I skip breakfast, I start really craving lunch at nine 'o clock.<br/><br/>(On a side note: The argument for breakfast being important is that it is necessary to fill up after 12 hours or so of no food. My philosophy is that it is probably better to fill up at dinner time, since you know your next meal is going to be a long way away. It all depends on whether you are the type to make sure there is enough petrol for the trip, or the type who is happy to push the car the last few kilometers to the petrol station to fill up.)<br/><br/>The whole issue got me wondering how animals manage. My dog gets fed exactly the same thing every day, twice a day, and has been for years. No wonder she ignores the food in her bowl and waits at the dinner table for our leftovers.<br/><br/>In an even worse situation are cows, which can only eat the leaves of grass. And pandas, who can only the shoots of certain species of bamboo plants. I really need to introduce them to steak and potato.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-04-19T17:18:00.006000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:39:34.577000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["domesticated animals", "food"]}

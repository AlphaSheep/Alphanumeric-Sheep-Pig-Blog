{"id": "on-alphabet-confusion", "title": "On Alphabet Confusion", "content": "Letter confusion, actually. Greek letters being used for artistic effect instead of the conventional Roman letters. Too look different, I guess.<div class=\"readmore\"> I\u2019m guilty of it too, sometimes. I\u2019ve used a \u2018\u03b3\u2019 to replace a \u2018y\u2019 even though it\u2019s pronounced like a \u2018g\u2019. I\u2019ve also used an \u2018\u03b7\u2019 instead of an \u2018n\u2019, even though it should be pronounced \u2018ee\u2019. I do it, but it\u2019s still funny when I see it done elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the title of a DVD recently, I saw a \u2018\u03a0\u2019 used instead on \u2018N\u2019, and it lead me to wonder. Are the people who did that aware that \u2018\u03a0\u2019 is pronounced the same as a roman \u2018P\u2019, and that the Greek \u2018\u03c1\u2019, which I\u2019ve seen used in place of a Roman \u2018p\u2019 (which would have been fine if it was a capital) is actually pronounced as the Roman \u2018r\u2019. And then there\u2019s \u2018\u03c7\u2019 to replace \u2018X\u2019, as in \u2018LaTe\u03c7\u2019, where \u2018\u03c7\u2019 is pronounced as a good phlegmy \u2018ch\u2019.<br/><br/>If that wasn\u2019t confusing enough, using \u2018\u03b2\u2019 instead of \u2018b\u2019 is all very well, since it is pronounced the same in the Greek and Roman systems, but if a German were to pick it up, he\u2019d be seriously confused, since to him, \u2018\u03b2\u2019 is pronounced as a solid \u2018ss\u2019.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-12-06T16:57:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:58:40.220000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["Germans", "language"]}

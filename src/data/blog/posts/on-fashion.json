{"id": "on-fashion", "title": "On Fashion", "content": "The other day, a group of friends and I saw a guy walk past wearing really tight bright red pants. Being engineers, we all pointed and laughed. Much later, I realised that this behaviour was wrong. We had initially assumed that this was the way he had chosen to dress, but maybe the choice was not his. After a bit of thought I realised that he might be a really great person.<div class=\"readmore\"> It is possible that in the morning, he had seen a kitten being savaged by a giant mutated sea frog with evil intentions. The guy might have jumped immediately to the rescue, and ripped off the head of the monster. The resulting spray of blood might have stained his pants red, and caused them to shrink. Because of the delay, he might have had time only to change his shirt and wash his hands and face, but there was not enough to time to change his pants, and he was forced to wear the stained pants for the rest of the day.<br/><br/>Then I saw him again this morning. He was wearing orange pants this time. I really feel sorry for him. He probably spent half the night fighting off an enraged flock of orange-blooded flying squids to protect a wounded puppy. He must lead such a difficult life.</div>", "published": "2009-03-18T17:25:00.004000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T15:54:44.153000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["fashion", "stereotypes"]}

The only problem is that it didn\u2019t come running out like it usually does. As a direct result, my entire face felt like it had been stuffed like a Christmas turkey. All I wished for was for my nose to run so that I could clear it out.<br/><br/>Needless to say, my wish came true \u2013 my nose is running... a lot. It is annoying to have to blow your nose every ten minutes, and the worst part is that my face still feels like the Christmas turkey (although I\u2019m not going to be tricked into thinking it might taste like stuffing, so don\u2019t even try that). Now I\u2019m just wishing that I will get better soon, but the universe doesn\u2019t grant wishes that often. Oh well, I guess it\u2019s just been a normal July...<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2010-07-27T08:45:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:35:40.569000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["exercise", "incompetence", "annoying things"]}

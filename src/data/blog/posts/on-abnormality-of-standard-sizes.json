Yet so often I find that things are designed for the most absurdly sized people. <div class=\"readmore\"> I am not particularly fat (in fact, apart from the bit of padding I've gained around my belly in the last couple of years, I am actually quite scrawny). However, whenever I try on pants, the size that fits me around the waist is almost always far to long and extremely baggy. If I get the size that fits my leg length and diameter comfortably, then the waist circumference is usually a good 5 cm too short to fit.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most confusing then, is that when I lie in bed and pull the duvet around my neck, I find that my feet stick out the bottom. I cannot work out how the standard length for a duvet was determined, but it was done wrong. How on earth people who are taller than me cope, I don't know.<br/><br/>I guess the five adult shirt sizes available in the shops show that the standards (if they can be called that, as poorly defined as they are) are completely arbitrary... On the shelves, you see S, M, L, XL, and XXL... implying that a mid sized person is considered large.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2011-06-09T10:48:00.007000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:07:39.626000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["annoying things"]}

Even forget the annoying bits like they don\u2019t know the rules of the road, and they stand right where I want to reverse my car.<div class=\"readmore\"> The thing that you should really take note of is that, if you are quick, and get out before he notices you (which is disturbingly easy) and begin to drive past the guard, he will direct you to an empty parking.

Which, I guess I don\u2019t need to point out, is stupid. In fact, I know more female Star Wars fans than male ones. Even my girlfriend is a huge Star Wars fan. So, because I believe that Katie has the right to like whatever she wants, I think you should wear a Star Wars shirt tomorrow (10 December 2010). If you don\u2019t have any, then wear anything Star Warsy. If you still don\u2019t have any, wear something geeky. If you don\u2019t even have anything geeky, just make a plan.

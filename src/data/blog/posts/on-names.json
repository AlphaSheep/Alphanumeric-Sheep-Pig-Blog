{"id": "on-names", "title": "On Names", "content": "It really bothers me that parents can give their child a name without considering the fact that the child will have to live with that name for the rest of its life. Before naming a child, you have to think through all of the embarrassing nicknames that can be easily derived from it.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>In South Africa, there is an incredible problem with this. There are thousands running around with names like Surprise, Innocence, Mistake and Success. I once even met someone named Intelligence. Her parents were ever the optimists.<br/><br/>The Dominican republic has a far greater problem. So bad, in fact, that the government has banned giving children unusual names. Unfortunately they were too late to save the child of Mr. and Mrs. Pineapple, who thought it a good idea to name their child Dear. If Dear Pineapple ever reads this, you have my sincerest sympathy.</div>", "published": "2009-05-03T14:01:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T12:57:07.249000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

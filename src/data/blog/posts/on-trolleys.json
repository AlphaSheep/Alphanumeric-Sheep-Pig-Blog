It seems that there must be some sort of law specifying a maximum level of coordination between the wheels.<div class=\"readmore\"> I can imagine some clause stating that:<br/><br/>\"No more than three wheels may point in the same direction at one time, excepting when: <ul><li>the trolley only has three wheels, in which case, only two may point in the same direction,</li><li>at least one of the wheels is in a completely uncontrolled oscillatory mode,</li><li>one wheel is not in contact with the ground, or</li><li>the driver of the trolley has absolutely no control.\"</li></ul><br/>Whatever the law states, it seems to be really well enforced. Although I have never seen anyone actually issuing fines for a straight trolley, I have also never encountered a trolley that breaks this law.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-04-15T15:37:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:39:07.362000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "engineering"]}

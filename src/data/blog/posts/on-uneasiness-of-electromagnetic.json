It is just as nerve-wracking to see the signal strength fluctuate eerily as the wind changes, almost as if the source of the signal is wandering around the house like a ghost. I\u2019m comfortable with most technology, but that is the one thing that gives me the heebie jeebies.<br/><br/>I know there are an endless number of electromagnetic signals passing through my bedroom all the time, but none of them are as personal as Wi-Fi. They don\u2019t have your neighbour\u2019s name attached to them. Anyway, I\u2019d better get on with my work... There are four different Wi-Fi signals roaming through my office, keeping watch.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2011-05-26T07:41:00+02:00", "updated": "2013-06-04T21:37:07.951000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology", "awkward situations"]}

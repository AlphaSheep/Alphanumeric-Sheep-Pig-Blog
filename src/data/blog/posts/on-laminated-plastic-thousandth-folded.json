You\u2019d need a motor to get going and to keep your chair from slowing. You\u2019d need to take friction into account, and here\u2019s something else to think about \u2013 those the ramjets will not go unless they have some air flow. It would actually be quite neat to program AI into your seat, so that you chair would always know exactly where to go, and do route optimization through distance minimization. The problem here, alas, would probably be it's mass which would definitely be too great for you to manually relocate. You\u2019d need a secondary engine to move into position. The other issue is extent so, unless its wings are bent, your chair will not be able to fit under the table, but soon this will not matter \u2013 I\u2019d like to modify the latter...</div>", "published": "2011-02-24T09:03:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T13:27:42.924000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["engineering", "poetry", "chairs"]}

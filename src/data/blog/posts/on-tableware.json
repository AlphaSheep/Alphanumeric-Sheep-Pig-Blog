The advert, as adverts for food usually do, included a photograph of a close-up of a carefully arranged meal on a plate, with cutlery and a drink in a glass...<div class=\"readmore\"> At the bottom of the advert, the fine print states \u201cTableware not included.\u201d The amusing thing is not that this has to be said... It\u2019s not that someone actually could think that the tableware is included, but rather that it would be included for free when the meal is ridiculously cheap to start with anyway.</div>", "published": "2010-03-21T15:21:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-16T09:34:31.117000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "advertising", "food"]}

Though his back end chute had given no more than a toot, he\u2019d found a fold in his boot.<div class=\"readmore\"> Said he on the seat, \u201cYou\u2019d think a fold so neat pride of origami elite.\u201d Then, with his big toe, he pushed it over just so, and the fold in the shoe did grow. After a second fold, too a sight to behold, the edges he slightly rolled. He continued this way, this strange new play, for more than half of the day. Numbered these folds in his shoe six hundred and two, and still onward they grew. And within a week, though his seat did reek, he\u2019d folded a flawless bird\u2019s beak. And though his cat lay dead, for it hadn\u2019t been fed, he didn\u2019t even think of his bed. But there that man died, because he was all bloated inside, and let that, child, be your guide.</div>", "published": "2010-09-23T07:04:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T13:46:40.996000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["poetry", "language"]}

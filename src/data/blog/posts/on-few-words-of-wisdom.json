Those who leave comments (and maybe one or two of you who don\u2019t) may have noticed the introduction of a word verification step (which I must admit, I hate), and then later on, manual comment moderation.<div class=\"readmore\"> No comment appears until I have read it personally. For those wondering why this is necessary, I have been getting comments consisting of some line in Chinese (which sounds as if they are taken directly from fortune cookies), such as \u201c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8cc7\u7522\uff0c \u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u8ad2\u89e3\u6642\uff0c \u90fd\u6210\u4e86\u8ca0\u50b5.\u201d Although they are occasionally surprisingly relevant to the post, and almost always give interesting words of wisdom when translated, I never publish them because they are followed by a string of full stops, each one linking to a site with strategically placed words like \u201cchat\u201d, \u201cgirl\u201d and \u201clive sex\u201d in the URLs. If only they would leave off the links, I\u2019d publish their comments.<br/><br/>I\u2019m sure this is some sort of plot by the Chinese government to control your minds though, so consider my comment moderation as me protecting you from becoming brainwashed zombies... But, thinking about it, maybe you\u2019re already zombies, so here is a sample of some of the wisdom I have gained. It can\u2019t do too much damage.<br/><ul><li>All of the assets, not being understanding, have become liabilities.</li><li>Survival but continued fighting in the heart and soul; writing is sitting the trial itself.</li><li>It is easier to get than to keep it.</li><li>Do not look for lessons from the failure of people, success is far away.</li><li>Happiness is not the key, only the ladder.</li><li>Tired? A cup of coffee, a rest!</li><li>Only endless teacher learning, teaching can be serious, only burn themselves to other people's lights lit.</li><li>Maturity is the ability to adapt to life in the vague.</li><li>Quality is better than quantity.</li><li>As a man sows, so he shall reap.</li><li>Hammer and nails to the same as always work toward fixed.</li><li>Enrichment within the letter of the most important! Beauty is but skin-deep.</li></ul><br/></div>", "published": "2010-08-10T17:28:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T14:35:36.764000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": []}

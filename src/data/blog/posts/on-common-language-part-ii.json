{"id": "on-common-language-part-ii", "title": "On Common Language Part II", "content": "A word that\u2019s always fascinated me is \u2018terrific\u2019. The true meaning of this word, if one looks at the origins, and follows the rules of language, the meaning is \u201cinvokes terror\u201d.<div class=\"readmore\"> So next time you say \u201cThat was terrific\u201d, bear in mind that you are actually saying is \u201cThat invoked terror.\u201d</div><br/><br/>I have heard that some parts of Europe use the word \u2018terrible\u2019 instead of \u2018terrific\u2019. This led to some mild confusion when someone told me \u201cThat band\u2019s terrible. I love them.\u201d Terrible would actually mean that it had the potential to invoke terror.<br/><br/>Its really weird how people twist the meanings of words over time.<br/><br/>(On a side note: No this idea wasn\u2019t planted in my head by Terry Pratchett\u2019s description of elves. The idea was there long before that, but when I did read it, it made me think, \u201cExactly!\u201d)<br/><br/>(On a completely unrelated side note, it\u2019s almost a year since Collin\u2019s English Dictionary wanted to remove the word \u2018skirr\u2019 from the English language, saying it\u2019s archaic and no longer in common use. I think its an awesome word (i.e, invokes awe). For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s the term used for the sound a birds wing makes as it moves through the air. The only nice formal definition I\u2019ve been able to find is: skirr (sk\u0289r): (v) to move, run, fly, etc. swiftly and, occasionally, with a whirring sound; (n) a whirring sound.)", "published": "2009-09-06T19:26:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:22:42.458000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["language"]}

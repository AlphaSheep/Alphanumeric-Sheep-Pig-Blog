I\u2019ve never actually stolen a monkey, but then again, the opportunity has never presented itself. I have no idea what I\u2019d actually do with a stolen monkey\u2026 I\u2019d probably have to take it back the next day.<br/><br/>(Another Google inspired post \u2013 my sincere apologies to the poor guy whose monkey was stolen, if that\u2019s why he was searching for it.

{"id": "on-excercise", "title": "On Excercise", "content": "The other day, my nose was running constantly. Not so much running as sprinting, at full pace. I think it\u2019s because of the cold weather. And I find it a bit frustrating. Yes, it\u2019s annoying having to blow my nose every ten minutes, but that\u2019s not the problem.<div class=\"readmore\"> The problem is that if I were to run for ten minutes, I\u2019d be absolutely exhausted, yet my nose can run for an entire day, 14 hours without a break. Even marathon runners can\u2019t do that. Surely this is a major flaw in the human body. Surely it would be more beneficial if the legs could run without getting tired, and the nose got exhausted after ten minutes. The world is so messed up.</div>", "published": "2009-07-05T18:27:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-05-03T15:02:47.736000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["exercise", "annoying things"]}

It\u2019s actually not really about anything, really.

What use is a title that doesn\u2019t tell you what to expect? It\u2019s a title without spoilers, that\u2019s what it is. Think about it. A title like <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> is a bad title because it contains spoilers. The title already gives away pretty much all of the story. It focuses on a girl called Alice, who lands up in Wonderland. Then as soon as the first young girl is introduced in the story, you start to wonder \u201cIs this Alice?\u201d until her name is revealed, instead of just enjoying the story. And then after Alice falls through the rabbit hole and has no clue where she is, all the suspense that could have been built up is wasted, all because the title tells you she is in Wonderland. It really does spoil the story. The purpose of a title is not to tell you what it\u2019s all about \u2013 it\u2019s to get you to read it, and if you thought this post had a bad title, well, you\u2019re reading it aren\u2019t you?<br/><br/>But that\u2019s all completely irrelevant. What is relevant is the title \u2013 in this case, picked completely arbitrarily (although not really randomly) to be <i>On Cheese Encrusted Bacon and a Loaf of Shoe</i>. Although cheese encrusted bacon certainly does sound good (although I\u2019ll probably pass on the loaf of shoe (only probably, because, after all, I\u2019m the sort of person who uses nested parentheses (sometimes even double nested parentheses) in his text, and it just might be edible), since it sounds like it may be chewy (and did you notice how parentheses distract your train of thought?)), it tells you absolutely nothing about what you are about to read. What it does reveal, however, is the weird way my brain always falls back onto one of two subjects \u2013 namely food or animals. I have no idea why it seems to do this so often, but it just does.<br/><br/>In fact, I\u2019ve gone back and tracked how often these two topics come up in my blog, and plotted a graph of how the fraction of the blog covering these two topics varies with time. At least it seems to be on a downward trend...<br/><br/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"data/images/mMHzoM8TScQ.jpg\" width=\"360\"/></div><br/>And then, even though it highlights the declining regularity of my posts, I was in a graph plotting mood, and wanted a second colour, so here are is a graph showing the total posts, and the animal and food related posts for each month.<br/><br/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"data/images/biN4acyXFPA.jpg\" width=\"360\"/></div></div>", "published": "2010-06-23T15:04:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:15:03.411000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["domesticated animals", "food"]}

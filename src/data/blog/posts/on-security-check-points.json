I can\u2019t help wondering how effective they actually are. I generally wear shoes with steel capped toes, and a belt with a metal buckle. My wallet has a number of key rings in it, as well as a magnetic bus tag. My other pocket contains a bunch of keys and a cell phone.<div class=\"readmore\"> All of these are items which would be picked up, even just slightly by the metal detector. They all set off alarms at the airport (especially my shoes).<br/><br/>Why then do they not make a sound half the time? The obvious reason is that they are not always switched on. It\u2019s quite hilarious to watch a security guard with a serious expression on his face scan you with his little metal detector, which is not even turned on.<br/><br/>I have to pass through one of these checkpoints at work every week. I make sure I carry as many bags as possible, and ask him, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to check the side compartments too?\u201d It annoys the people behind me, but I\u2019m thinking of sneaking a piece of steel pipe past them one day to see how easy it is.</div>", "published": "2009-05-17T19:37:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-05-03T15:03:05.223000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["annoying things"]}

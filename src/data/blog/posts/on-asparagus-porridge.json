{"id": "on-asparagus-porridge", "title": "On Asparagus Porridge", "content": "Or something like that... I\u2019m not sure, but who really knows. During an amazing meal of a pineapple and chicken dish my mom occasionally makes, I was chewing perhaps a little too enthusiastically (although it really wasn\u2019t necessary \u2013 the chicken was soft and tender), and I bit my tongue.<div class=\"readmore\"> I do it often (maybe I should review my eating habits), so I\u2019m used to it by now. The taste of blood in my mouth and the sharp pain are tolerable, and it\u2019s easy enough to just get on with the meal, especially if it's a good one.<br/><br/>The problem was that, this time, it would not heal. Every time I ate, there was a sharp pain from the side of my tongue. It called for a rinsing of anti-something-or-other mouthwash, which is all very well. The stuff definitely works, but along with the something-or-other bacteria or whatever that it destroys, it also destroys any taste buds in your mouth. <br/><br/>That was 18 hours ago, and you\u2019d think any numbness caused would have worn off by now, but it hasn\u2019t. I just ate a sandwich, and I\u2019m sure it had beef on it. At least, that\u2019s what it looked like, but it really tasted exactly how I\u2019d imagine asparagus flavoured porridge to taste. I really hope new taste buds grow, because I rather enjoy my food. It would be terrible if everything tasted like this forever...</div>", "published": "2009-12-20T14:02:00.001000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:03:21.456000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["food"]}

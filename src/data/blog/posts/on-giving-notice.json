It\u2019s really just a nuisance, but I do understand why this sort of thing would be desirable.<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>In case you haven\u2019t worked it out yet, it is to give you enough time to think of a new unbreakable password. The fact that most people don\u2019t, and just use a password as predictable as the last is irrelevant and Microsoft cannot change that. All that they can do is give plenty of opportunities to change it.<br/><br/>The reason for including the option to change the password immediately, instead of waiting two weeks for it to expire, is just in case the user thinks of a brilliant unbreakable password. It is quite possible that the user won\u2019t be able to remember this password after 14 days, and so Windows allows the user to change it early. That way, at least if they forget the password, their security won\u2019t be compromised by them using a simpler password. They won\u2019t be able to log in, but that\u2019s not a problem, is it?<br/><br/>On the topic of logging in (actually, more along the lines of logging off),  have you noticed how, after installing a new program, as soon as you click on the Start button to log off, an excited message pops up saying \u201cNew programs  installed! Click here to see them!\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant marketing scam.<br/><br/>(On a side note: Why do you log in, and then log off? Why did they not think when they coined these terms. At least they seem to be changing these days.)</div>", "published": "2009-08-09T13:27:00.003000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:29:08.825000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["technology"]}

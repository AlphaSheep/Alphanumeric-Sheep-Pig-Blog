{"id": "on-procrastination", "title": "On Procrastination", "content": "I\u2019ve always wondered why car companies show off these amazing \u201cconcept\u201d cars, which are impractical and too expensive to build, and probably wouldn\u2019t sell anyway. In the end, most new cars are only modifications of previous models, so surely it\u2019s far more efficient to focus their energy on fixing up the current model?<div class=\"readmore\"> The car manufacturers say that it\u2019s to encourage creativity, and thinking out of the box, and that thousands of new ideas on the concept cars get incorporated into production cars. I disagree. I think it\u2019s a natural and necessary form of procrastination.<br/><br/>My final design project was due this week, and, like every project I\u2019ve done since I started primary school, things seemed to drag out until the last minute, regardless of how much work had been put in before the deadline. Perhaps it\u2019s a bit late to realize this now, but I\u2019ve finally worked out why. It\u2019s exactly what drives engineers to develop fancy concept cars. There are aspects of any project that are really boring (like paperwork), and then there are aspects that are enjoyable (like creative design work). It\u2019s only natural that any work that takes place a long time before the deadline will be the more enjoyable work, i.e. the creative design work. That\u2019s why, when engineers are told to come up with the next new model of car, a fair portion of their time goes into stuff that they know will never be used. Rather than waste this time, car companies release the results as \u201cconcept\u201d cars, and make it seem deliberate, even though it\u2019s really an unwanted byproduct of the thought process.</div>", "published": "2009-10-25T14:17:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2011-03-07T14:10:38.497000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["engineering"]}

I came across a story about someone who was less fortunate: <a href=\"http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~det/phy2060/heavyboots.html\">Link: Heavy Boots</a><br/><br/>The scariest part of the story is not that the philosopher knew nothing (which is partly expected), but rather that 57% of the first year physics students also knew nothing. So many people should not be allowed through high school. <br/><br/>I had a similar experience. I was remarkably surprised to discover in that 95% of my philosophy class, made up of mostly second year chemical engineers, did not believe in evolution. We live in a scary world indeed.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-07-12T19:05:00.006000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:23:48.314000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["incompetence", "philosophy"]}

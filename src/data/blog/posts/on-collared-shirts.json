I don't even understand why they are considered more formal than T-shirts. In fact, I don't really get what makes anything formal, but that's beside the point.<div class=\"readmore\"> The only possible advantage that I can see for a collared shirt is that it can be taken off without having to remove one's hat. However, I don't really see why anyone would really care about that (perhaps with the exception of strippers, of course). I really prefer comfort over anything else. That is why my casual outfit consists of jeans and a T-shirt, and my formal wear consists of newer jeans and a slightly neater T-shirt.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2012-04-12T15:23:00+02:00", "updated": "2012-04-17T16:57:07.820000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["fashion"]}

{"id": "on-humans-and-monkeys", "title": "On Humans and Monkeys", "content": "You hear people saying that humans are just hairless monkeys. Well, maybe you don't hear it, but I do. Sometimes. Occasionally. Once or twice. But that doesn't matter. The truth is that it is wrong.<div class=\"readmore\"> The important bit that has been forgotten is the tail. We are apes, not monkeys, falling into the hominid family. On that note, we are the scrawniest hominids around. As if that wasn't bad enough, we are also have lowest strength per body mass. And then, we had to be the stupidest.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that all chimpanzees and orangutans are smart, and I'm not saying that all humans are stupid, but I think on average, the evolutionary tree has led humans to be pretty retarded. Few have any real problem solving capabilities, yet most chimpanzees do. It's really sad, but that's the way things turned out, and there's not much that can be done about it.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-07-19T19:35:00.005000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:23:45.100000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["stereotypes"]}

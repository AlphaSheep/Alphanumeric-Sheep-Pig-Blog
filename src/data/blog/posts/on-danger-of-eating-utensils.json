Still does, occasionally. \u201cDon\u2019t put your knife in your mouth. You\u2019ll cut your tongue off.\u201d It\u2019s a stupid thing to say. The knife\u2019s barely sharp enough to cut the food, and I\u2019m not stupid enough to run the blade along my tongue. In all my years of eating, I have never injured myself with a knife (at least, not in my mouth).<div class=\"readmore\"><br/><br/>The fork is a different matter. No one ever warns you about the fork. The knife has a single slightly sharp edge. The fork has four sharp points. It\u2019s far easier to hurt yourself with a fork than with a knife.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2009-08-16T14:53:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2013-01-21T15:23:19.242000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["food"]}

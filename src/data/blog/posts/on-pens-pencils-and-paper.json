{"id": "on-pens-pencils-and-paper", "title": "On Pens, Pencils and Paper", "content": "I write almost exclusively in pencil. I heard once from a friend (I cannot remember who it was) that psychologists say that this indicates a lack of confidence. <div class=\"readmore\"> The ability to erase any errors when using a pencil is definitely part of the reason that I use them, but it is not because I lack confidence in my abilities. I change what I am writing a lot. I rewrite each sentence a couple of times until I get the wording as I want it. I do this because whenever I read a sentence that I have written, I know that I am capable of composing a better sentence. As a result, my pen-written work is always an incredible mess, with more crossed out than not, which makes it rather difficult to read.<br/><br/>The real reason I prefer pencil, however, is because of the way I turn and spin the pen in my hand when I think. When I was still in school, and forced to write in blue pen, my hands and shirts (and occasionally my face \u2013 don't ask how) would be covered in inky stripes. Even after using a pen for five minutes to fill out a form, I inevitably have at least a couple of stripes across my palm.<br/><br/>These days, however, I favour typing over pencil. It's just easier not to have to worry about the corners of the paper folding. How it happens, I don't know, but it just may be caused by the way I move around as I write and think. All I know is that it used to frustrate my grade 7 history teacher beyond belief.<br/><br/>On the note of folding paper, I have finally gotten around my problem of the corners of pages and the spines of books folding over as I read them. It was simply a matter of moving into the future. I now find electronic copies of any book I want to read. I've actually reached the stage where a paper book is just to clumsy and awkward that I can no longer even sit and read one for any extended length of time.<br/><br/> </div>", "published": "2012-03-06T09:53:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2012-03-06T09:53:30.047000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["pencil", "technology"]}

{"id": "on-third-arbitrarily-defined-solar", "title": "On the Third Arbitrarily Defined Solar Cycle", "content": "The thing that I am perhaps most proud of about this last year is how the Google searches bringing visitors to my site have changed.<div class=\"readmore\"> From the early searches about squirrels laying eggs, ants eating houses, and the finer details of inter species animal breeding, the internet has finally moved on to searching for things like \"nether wart\", \"sun diagram\", and \" minecraft variable enchantment table\". I still get many strange searches that lead to my blog, such as \"pig on a blue screen\" or \"why is there a dead pakistani on my couch\", but I suppose there is no helping some people.<br/><br/>This last year marked my first viral post, the post on <a href=\"http://www.alphasheep.co.za/2011/09/on-analysis-of-minecraft-mining.html\">Minecraft mining efficiencies</a>, which attracted over 11 000 visitors within 24 hours of being posted.<br/><br/>My readership is more international than ever, reaching 92 different countries (or 40 before the viral post). The top ten countries contributing to my readership were the US, UK, Canada, South Africa, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, each of which contributed well over a hundred unique visits. At this rate, I'm spreading across the world even faster than those penguins, which for some obscure reason just turned around and marched (swam) straight back to Antarctica as soon as the seasons changed. They are up to something. I just know it.<br/><br/>So to the 20 091 visitors who contributed to the 35 034 page views that my blog has had in the last three years, thank you. If you are lucky, I just might have some more absolute rubbish to feed you for another year.<br/><br/></div>", "published": "2012-01-17T07:56:00+02:00", "updated": "2012-01-17T07:56:57.415000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["those damn penguins", "land marks"]}

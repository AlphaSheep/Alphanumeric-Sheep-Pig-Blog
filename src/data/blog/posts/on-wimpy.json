As a defence, they put tables of nutritional information out on most of their meals.<div class=\"readmore\"> It was interesting to note the fat and energy content of their new breakfast, the \u201cFlat Bread Stack Breakfast\u201d, which I had enjoyed the day before without looking at what was in it (I saw a picture and thought \u201cfoooood\u201d. It was good). Apart from the fact that it provides roughly two thirds of a typical person\u2019s daily energy requirement, I was amazed to see that the nutritional information at the bottom of the advert on the sauce holder thingy claims that the total fat content of the meal is 55.9kg. That\u2019s more than what I weighed all through high school. Wow.</div>", "published": "2010-12-08T14:44:00.002000+02:00", "updated": "2011-04-07T13:03:54.127000+02:00", "draft": false, "categories": ["advertising", "restaurants", "food"]}
